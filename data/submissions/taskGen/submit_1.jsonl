If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects.", "simplified": "Society tells us that girls should like arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to boys. This is also because we don't see many women doing science jobs. Cartoons and stories often show men as scientists, inventors, or astronauts. People also think that scientists are strange, don't have many friends, or work alone. These ideas are not true, but they might stop girls from being interested in science. If girls saw more women doing science, it would give them more confidence and make them feel like they belong in those subjects.", "text_id": "116-b1", "target_cefr": "b1"}
{"original": "The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural enrichment and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as litter on campus.", "simplified": "The Scallion is a weekly newspaper that's free and given to around 10,000 students in the faculty buildings.

{"original": "So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.", "simplified": "A lot of what the speaker said is true.

{"original": "Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.", "simplified": "When you give feedback, make sure to balance positive and negative comments. If you always give them together, people may start to ignore the positives. So, it's good to give them separately sometimes.\n\nFirst, give feedback that is just positive. Don't always try to say something negative. This helps people feel good about what they did well. \n\nWhen you want to say something good, be specific. Instead of just saying \"good job,\" say what you liked about it. For example, \"I liked how you handled that difficult situation\" or \"Your work was clear and easy to understand.\"\n\nOnly say something negative when it's really needed. Don't bring up problems that aren't important or that the person already knows about.\n\nWhen you do say something negative, focus on what the person did wrong, not on who they are as a person. Say what you want them to change, not what's wrong with them.\n\nUse \"I\" statements to express your thoughts. Instead of saying \"you did this wrong,\" say \"I felt confused by this.\" This way, you're not attacking the person.\n\nWhen you get feedback, listen carefully and think about what the other person is saying. This shows you value their opinion and are willing to learn from them.", "text_id": "120-b1", "target_cefr": "b1"}
