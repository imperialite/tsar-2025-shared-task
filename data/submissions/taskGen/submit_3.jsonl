It's written and made by students themselves. \n\nMany students like the newspaper because it's fun and helps them learn about different cultures. It also looks good on their CV. However, printing the newspaper is very expensive. Some students can't easily get a copy because you have to physically go to the university to get one. \n\nAnother problem is that many copies of the newspaper end up on the ground as litter.

{"original": "So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you.", "simplified": "A lot of what the speaker said is true.

{"original": "Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. When positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism.", "simplified": "When you give feedback, make sure to balance positive and negative comments. If you always give them together, people may start to ignore the positives. So, it's good to give them separately sometimes.\n\nFirst, give feedback that is just positive. Don't always try to say something negative. This helps people feel good about what they did well. \n\nWhen you want to say something good, be specific. Instead of just saying \"good job,\" say what you liked about it. For example, \"I liked how you handled that difficult situation\" or \"Your work was clear and easy to understand.\"\n\nOnly say something negative when it's really needed. Don't bring up problems that aren't important or that the person already knows about.\n\nWhen you do say something negative, focus on what the person did wrong, not on who they are as a person. Say what you want them to change, not what's wrong with them.\n\nUse \"I\" statements to express your thoughts. Instead of saying \"you did this wrong,\" say \"I felt confused by this.\" This way, you're not attacking the person.\n\nWhen you get feedback, listen carefully and think about what the other person is saying. This shows you value their opinion and are willing to learn from them.", "text_id": "120-b1", "target_cefr": "b1"}
