Some dogs were born wild, and others were once pets but were left by their owners. Some dogs live alone, and some live in packs. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted well to city life. They know it is safer to cross the street with people, and some dogs seem to understand traffic lights."}

On her website, she says the idea came after she saw a girl on the street whose face looked different. Wonder is a bestseller in the United States. It has won several awards. Many schools use the book to start talks about bullying, friendship, and being different. People are making a film of the book. Many people, like me, want to see what RJ Palacio writes next."}

She often explains that rats are not dirty and can be great pets if you look after them well. She understands why people react badly. She did not like rats before, but then her friend Martin showed her his rats. She saw they were affectionate and intelligent. Last year, one of Martin's rats had babies, so Chloe decided to have two of them."}

Baboons are in danger. The city council has a team called Baboon Monitors. The team helps baboons and tries to stop problems with people. The monitors chase baboons out of the city. They also catch baboons and take them to the countryside. This plan works a bit, but it is hard to stop baboons from coming back. They see the city as an easy place to find food."}

I do not waste time traveling or talking too much with colleagues. I work on different projects, and this flexible schedule is helpful. If my children have a school event or I have a dentist appointment, I can take time off. The problem is that I do not have set work hours, so I often work late into the evening. Sometimes I even skip dinner to finish my work."}
{"text_id": "27-a2", "simplified": "In the 1990s, graffiti stayed popular. Street art also grew fast around the world. Some artists wanted to talk about politics. They made art to make people think about war, unfairness, and unfair treatment. Other artists wanted to create beautiful work. In South America, many street artists worked in poor areas. They painted grey city walls and added color, life, and beauty."}
{"text_id": "28-a2", "simplified": "Social media, magazines, and shop windows show people many things to buy every day. British people are buying more clothes and shoes than ever before.

They did not care that their owner came for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter did not come here often. He only came if he must. Sam liked this. Sam wanted to keep his job, so he stayed away from his boss. Mr Carter wiped sweat from his neck. His shirt was wet. The wet parts looked like shapes on a map. His skin was red from the June sun. He usually stayed inside. He made money, and other people did the work for him."}

Warmer winters help more pigs live, so there are more pigs than before."}
{"text_id": "31-a2", "simplified": "Suzanne Collins loves old Greek myths. This love gave her ideas for The Hunger Games. When she was a child, her favorite story was Theseus and the Minotaur. In that story, Crete rules the city of Athens. The people of Athens fight back. As a punishment, King Minos makes them send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The young people are thrown into a maze. A monster called the Minotaur lives there and eats them. But one young man, Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a future Theseus."}

{"text_id": "33-a2", "simplified": "There is a new idea that says we should not buy too many things. It is called 'Buy Nothing.' It started in Canada in the early 1990s. Later it came to the United States. In the U.S., people use it to say no to Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Thanksgiving weekend. These are big shopping days. Many people spend too much money then and buy too many things. On Buy Nothing Day, people join protests. Some people even cut up their credit cards. During the year, Buy Nothing groups also have events to trade and fix things. People bring things they already have to trade or to fix."}
{"text_id": "34-a2", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? Different people have different ideas.

Many city councils say it costs a lot of money to clean graffiti from buildings, buses, and trains."}
{"text_id": "35-a2", "simplified": "What do people in the art world think about graffiti and street art? Today, more people say it is real art. There were big street art shows in galleries in Paris, London, and Los Angeles. In 2008, the American artist Elura Emerald organized a street art show at a gallery in New York. She defended street artists. She said they only express themselves and do not hurt anyone. She said we should enjoy and celebrate them."}
{"text_id": "36-a2", "simplified": "Most people have four to six dreams every night after they are ten years old. That means they have about 2,000 dreams each year. When they are 80 years old, they might have had 140,000 dreams in their life. We forget most of our dreams - maybe 95 to 99 percent of them. But we still remember a few thousand dreams in our lifetime. So it is not surprising that sometimes we dream about something, and then a similar thing happens in real life. This happens by chance, especially when we dream about things that happen often in everyday life."}

Then something happens and calls the hero to an adventure. This adventure changes everything. At the start of Star Wars, Luke lives a normal life with his aunt and uncle. He repairs robots. He finds a message from Princess Leia to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2-D2. This message is the 'call to adventure.' It starts Luke's journey."}
{"text_id": "41-a2", "simplified": "Scientists have another idea to stop an asteroid from hitting Earth: use a nuclear weapon to destroy it. This idea may sound like a movie story—after all, it was in the 1998 film Armageddon—but NASA has a real plan called HAMMER. Big rockets, weighing eight tons, would fly toward the asteroid and try to push it away. If the asteroid comes too close, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to blow it up instead."}
{"text_id": "42-a2", "simplified": "The hero first refuses the call to adventure. Then a mentor arrives and helps. The hero crosses the threshold and enters a special world. There, the hero passes tests, fights enemies, and meets friends to prepare for the biggest challenge. For Luke, Obi-Wan is the mentor, Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO are his friends, and Darth Vader is the enemy on the Death Star."}

{"text_id": "44-a2", "simplified": "In the 1700s and 1800s, two main ideas about dreams became popular. The first idea says that dreams show things our awake mind cannot see. Freud said that if we understand our dreams, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. The second idea is the opposite. It says that dreams are only brain activity without order while the brain sorts memories and things from the day. When we wake up, we try to understand these mixed images and feelings and make a story from them."}

There were too many distractions, like housework, making tea, and my family asking for help. Then I went to a café, but the Wi-Fi was not good, and I drank too much coffee. In the end, I rented a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers. I enjoy getting dressed for work each morning and being able to focus in an office."}

After that, his family and teachers let him decide for himself about religion."}
{"text_id": "49-a2", "simplified": "Some people think that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. A lucid dream is when you know you are dreaming, and you can change what happens. For example, you can make a scary dream feel safe, or you can control the story like a movie director. Then you are not just looking for the meaning of your dreams, but you are creating them. However, you might still want some dreams to happen naturally, so your subconscious can show you what is on your mind."}
{"text_id": "50-a2", "simplified": "People give unwanted clothes to charity. They think this means they are not part of the clothing waste problem. But charity shops cannot sell all the clothes. Fast fashion goes out of style very quickly. It is often poor quality and hard to recycle. People do not want to buy it second-hand. So many clothes are thrown away. Many clothes that do not sell are sent to other countries. This causes more problems for people and for the environment."}

She climbed the highest mountain on each continent, rode her bike across Canada, and ran a long-distance race in the Sahara Desert, where it was 45°C. Her most impressive journey was a skiing trip to the South Pole. On the first day, she fell into a glacier and needed help to escape. Many people would have stopped then, but Meagan continued. After forty days, she reached the South Pole, pulling a sledge with her tent and food through freezing weather and ice storms."}

Now, every adult in the UK owes about £670 to credit card companies. This is 66% of the money they spend on clothes. Also, people buy clothes with money they don't have.

You also need at least one person you can talk to about your personal feelings. This is called self-disclosure. One close person is enough if you also have other friends. It is not enough to have many friends only for fun or small talk about music or football. A deep connection is very important.

But studies show that focusing on how we do things—praising effort, trying new methods, and finding solutions—helps us develop new skills and improve our talents."}

Methane lasts only a few hundred years. So something on Mars adds new methane. NASA says Mars lets out thousands of tons of methane at a time. The methane level goes up and down with the seasons, like the planet is breathing."}
{"text_id": "94-a2", "simplified": "Professor Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford University, gave some ten-year-old children difficult problems when she started her work. One group of children were very positive. They liked challenges and knew they could get better. Professor Dweck called this a 'growth mindset.' These children thought about what they could learn and do in the future. But the other group of children felt people were judging them and thought they failed. This was a 'fixed mindset.' They thought they could not get better. Some children said they might cheat later. Other children would look for people who did worse than them. This made them feel better."}
{"text_id": "95-a2", "simplified": "Horror films like empty places. They might show an abandoned hospital, a scary empty house, or a ghost town with no people. These lonely places make us think. We ask what life was like there. We ask why people left. They are very quiet, and the quiet can be scary. These places also help horror film directors. Viewers can believe there is no mobile phone signal there."}
{"text_id": "96-a2", "simplified": "In horror movies, the basement in any house is scary. Often, someone hides there, or a bad person keeps tools there. The basement is always dark and often wet. You can only go down very narrow stairs to the basement. Even when there is nothing down there, the basement still makes people afraid."}

The police had 200,000 hours of video, but the face-recognition computer found only one person."}

This idea will become normal in the future."}
{"text_id": "99-a2", "simplified": "The talk was very interesting. The speaker made some very good points. Children copy their parents. Parents use social media while they cook dinner or wait at a red light. Teenagers see this. Then they also text while they do homework. The speaker also said that people want to be in more than one place at the same time. They change between real-life talk and online chat. I see this with my teenage daughter and her friends. They plan to meet. Then they sit together in silence. Each one chats online with someone else."}
{"text_id": "100-a2", "simplified": "Some news stories make us think the world is getting more violent. But there is some good news too. From the end of World War II to 1990, there were 30 wars. Each of these wars killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but most countries live more peacefully than before. Terrorism has increased a lot in the last few years. Since World War II, wars have killed more civilians than soldiers. Even so, not all the numbers are bad for civilians. People are about nine times more likely to die from violent crime than from political conflict. The global murder rate went down a little. It was 8 per 100,000 people in 2000. It was about 5.3 in 2015."}

These projects taught and trained women and girls. But when the projects ended, the women got nothing. Wasfia decided that Bangladesh needed to help itself. She joined her two passions: mountain climbing and human rights. She wants to change how people see women in her country. She started climbing while she worked on aid campaigns in Tibet and Nepal. Bangladesh is a flat country by the sea, so most people there have never seen a mountain. Her work is helping. People in Bangladesh and around the world are paying attention."}

They think dictators control these countries. They think there is little hope for change. But this is not true. A big change is happening. In the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their income and left poverty. Every year, six million fewer children die from disease. Millions more girls go to school. Millions more people have clean water."}

Today, the military already uses drones, gun turrets, and sentry robots that kill with little human control. The next step is autonomous 'murderbots.' They follow orders but decide who to kill on their own. I believe this is wrong and dangerous for everyone. We must be careful about what tasks we allow machines to do."}

You know this way: say something nice, say the real problem, say something nice again."}
{"text_id": "107-a2", "simplified": "'Born in the USA' is a fast rock album that makes people tap their feet. The music sounds good, and the lyrics have a lot of feeling. It shows another side of the American dream: some people work very hard but do not become rich or famous, so they feel sad or angry. For example, 'Glory Days' is about small-town people who remember their happy youth, and 'Downbound Train' is about a young man who loses his job and struggles in life. We can imagine these stories come from the singer's friends or from his own life. If he had not become a star, he might also live like this. The album shows that 'The Boss' is very special and very talented."}
{"text_id": "108-a2", "simplified": "Lewis wants more parts of the ocean to be protected. He hopes this will grow from 3% to 10%. This will help fix problems made by people. For example, people catch too many fish, make the water dirty, and throw trash. On his trips, Lewis saw these problems himself. He swam over coral that was white because the water was too hot. He also saw the bottom of the Red Sea. It looked empty, like a desert, with no animals or plants, only plastic trash. Pugh thinks nature can get healthy again if we give it room. But we don't have much time. If we don't start to protect the ocean, we will soon have a very big problem we cannot fix."}

People live longer. People are healthier, freer, and happier. But there is a problem, he says. Some people attack reason and science. Some leaders and people on TV or online use fear and anger. They push people to think 'us versus them.' They say nothing can change. They tell people not to trust others. This can hurt important systems. It can harm democracy and cooperation between countries. The damage can be hard to fix."}
{"text_id": "111-a2", "simplified": "In older horror movies, the main characters often could not call for help or call the police when they were in trouble. Now, mobile phones make that less believable. So, filmmakers usually show no phone signal to keep the tension. If you are a hero in a horror movie, you will almost certainly lose phone coverage right when you need to call for help. Or your phone battery will die at that exact moment. Or both."}

Now the same thing is happening to the Cavendish, the banana that came after it. The Gros Michel had thick skin and a sweet taste, and it was easy to send far. It was the main banana on farms in Central America. United Fruit was the main grower in South America then, and it sold bananas to other countries. The company grew bananas in a fast and cheap way. It cut pieces from plant stems to make new plants instead of using seeds. It planted the bananas very close together."}

Spider bites can hurt, but they are rarely deadly. Australia has a spider called the Sydney funnel-web. Since 1981, anti-venom has stopped deaths from this spider. Be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. When they feel danger, they throw tiny, itchy hairs into the air. These hairs can get into your skin or eyes and cause irritation."}
{"text_id": "114-a2", "simplified": "This was a common story in horror movies in the late 1900s. A group of teenagers have fun at the start. In the end, everyone dies except one girl.

{"text_id": "115-a2", "simplified": "We want to know where our complex language came from. We must look at our brains. Our brains are different from animal brains. This is not just about brain size. We need to know what our brains can do, and when and why they changed. We have few clues about this. Old tools from our ancestors do not tell us how they spoke. But we can see one thing in old human bones: how their mouth, throat, and tongue changed. By 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simple sounds to talk."}
{"text_id": "116-a2", "simplified": "People, not nature, tell us that girls should like arts and languages. They tell us that boys should study maths and physics. Children do not see many women who work in science. Cartoons and stories often show the scientist, the very smart inventor, or the brave astronaut as a man. Many people think scientists are nerdy, not good at talking, and lonely. They think science is far from real life. The media gives us these ideas, but they are not true. These ideas can make girls feel that science is not for them. Girls may think science is not interesting or not a good job. If girls see more good examples of women in science, they get more confidence and feel welcome in those subjects."}

{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified": "I agree with the speaker. When we spend more time online, we can feel more alone. For my generation, this is not a big problem. We lived many years without technology. We can be alone, and we know it is OK. But many people under 20 years old are different. They are always sending messages and talking online. They do not have quiet time alone. They may not learn to enjoy their own company. They also learn to talk by writing messages that they can change. This makes it hard to learn real conversation. In real life, you talk to the person in front of you right away, and you cannot change your words."}
{"text_id": "120-a2", "simplified": "Do not always give a negative comment after a good comment. If you always put good and bad comments together, people stop caring about the good ones.

In Moscow, there are approximately 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets. Some of the dogs were born wild, while others are pets that have been left behind by their owners. Some dogs live alone and others live in packs. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs and discovered that the dogs have adapted very successfully to city life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people and some dogs appear to understand traffic lights."}

Baboons are an endangered species. So, to save them and reduce problems with people, the city council has hired a team of Baboon Monitors. These monitors chase baboons out of cities. They also catch them and let them go in the countryside. This plan has worked a little. However, it is hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city when they find easy food there."}

This means I don't waste time commuting or making small talk with colleagues. My work is project-based, and this flexibility is very valuable to me. It means I can easily take time off when my children need me for school plays, or when I need to make a dentist's appointment. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work late into the evening. Sometimes I even skip dinner to finish a task."}
{"text_id": "27-b1", "simplified": "In the 1990s, graffiti continued but there was also an explosion in street art around the world. Some artists wanted to make political points and produced art that tried to make people think about war, unfairness and discrimination. Other street artists were more concerned with producing beautiful, attractive work. In South America, many street artists went to work in poor areas adding colour, life and beauty to grey, city walls."}

Mr Carter only came out here when he had to, and that was fine with Sam. The more he stayed out of his boss's way, the longer he would keep his job. Mr Carter rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck. The damp spots on his shirt ran together like shapes on a map. His skin was already turning red in the June sun. Otherwise, he had the indoor look of a man who made money while other people did the work."}

Because of the protests, the city council decided to use more peaceful methods against the pigs. Instead of shooting them, they built fences and made it against the law to feed the pigs. We will see if this plan works, but it might be a fight they cannot win. This is because warmer winters mean there are more pigs now than before."}
{"text_id": "31-b1", "simplified": "One important inspiration for the book The Hunger Games comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek myths. When she was a child, one of her favorite stories was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the Athenians rebel. As punishment, Minos, the king of Crete, forces the people of Athens to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The young people are thrown into a maze called the Labyrinth and are eaten by a monster called the Minotaur that lives there. But one of the young people, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a future version of Theseus."}

On Buy Nothing Day, people organize different kinds of protests and cut up their credit cards. All year round, Buy Nothing groups organize the exchange and repair of things they already own."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? It depends on your point of view, but in many countries, writing or painting on public or private property is considered vandalism.

{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "What does the art world think of graffiti and street art? Recently, there has been more and more understanding of its value as an art form. There have been major exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles. The American artist Elura Emerald organised a street art exhibition at a New York gallery in 2008. She defended street artists. She said, 'Artists who paint on the street are merely expressing themselves, not hurting anyone. They should be appreciated and celebrated'."}
{"text_id": "36-b1", "simplified": "If most people have four to six dreams every night after the age of ten, that's as many as 2,000 dreams per year. So, by the time they reach 80 years old the average person might have had 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95–99 per cent of our dreams, that's still a few thousand remembered dreams across a person's life. It's not too difficult to believe that, by chance, a dream event is followed by a real-life event that's similar to it, especially if the subject of the dream is something that happens often in everyday life."}

Some brave baboons even enter people's houses and take food from kitchen cupboards and refrigerators! Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked many pets, so many city residents do not want them around."}

Typically the hero starts the story living an ordinary life, but something happens that calls them to an adventure that changes everything. At the beginning of Star Wars, Luke lives an ordinary life with his aunt and uncle, repairing robots. When he finds Princess Leia's message to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2D2, it is 'the call to adventure' that starts the hero on his journey."}
{"text_id": "41-b1", "simplified": "Another idea to protect Earth from a dangerous space rock coming towards us is to destroy it with a nuclear bomb. This might sound like a story from a movie, and it was actually used in the 1998 movie Armageddon, but HAMMER (a special space program) is a real plan from the American space agency. Large missiles weighing eight tons would be shot at the space rock to try to push it away from Earth. If the space rock was too close to Earth for this plan to work, the missiles would carry nuclear bombs to destroy it completely."}
{"text_id": "42-b1", "simplified": "According to Campbell, the hero first refuses the call to adventure. But then, a mentor appears and helps him. So, the hero decides to 'cross the threshold' and go into the 'special world' where the adventure takes place. The next step is to pass tests, fight enemies, and meet friends. While doing this, the hero prepares to face his biggest challenge. For Luke, the mentor is, of course, Obi-Wan. His friends are Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO. And the enemy is Darth Vader, in the special world of the Death Star."}

{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea said that what we see in dreams stands for something hidden from our conscious mind. Freud believed that if we understand our dreams, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. The other idea was the opposite. It said that dreams are just random brain activity while the brain sorts memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these random images and feelings and turn them into a kind of story."}

At first, I worked from home, but I found it very hard to concentrate. There were too many distractions: housework that needed doing, another cup of tea, and family members who also wanted my attention. Next, I tried working in a nearby café, but the Wi-Fi was not good, and I drank too much coffee. In the end, I decided to rent a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers. I liked getting dressed for work in the morning and being able to focus in an office environment."}

Some YouTube stars now encourage their watchers not to buy anything at all for periods as long as a year. Two friends in Canada spent a year working towards buying only food. For the first three months they learned how to live without buying electrical goods, clothes or things for the house. For the next stage, they gave up services, for example haircuts, eating out at restaurants or buying petrol for their cars. In one year, they'd saved $55,000."}

To everyone's surprise, Pi declares himself to be at the same time Hindu, Muslim and Christian. When his family and teachers ask him to choose just one religion, Pi refuses, saying 'I just want to love God'. From that moment, his family and teachers decide to let him make his own mind up about religion."}
{"text_id": "49-b1", "simplified": "Some people think that writing down dreams can help open the mind to lucid dreaming. Lucid dreams are dreams where you know that you are dreaming. In these dreams, you can also make choices to change what happens in the dream. For example, you might change a bad dream into a safe dream. Or you can control the dream story like a movie director. Instead of just trying to understand what dreams mean, you create them yourself. But you might still want to have some normal dreams that let your mind show you what you are thinking about."}

But charity shops can't sell all those unwanted clothes. 'Fast fashion' goes out of fashion as quickly as it came in and is often too poor quality to recycle; people don't want to buy it second-hand. Huge quantities end up being thrown away, and a lot of clothes that charities can't sell are sent abroad, causing even more economic and environmental problems."}

Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed the highest mountain on each continent. She has also cycled across Canada and ran a long distance race in the Sahara Desert when it was 45°C. But perhaps her most incredible journey was skiing to the South Pole. On the first day, she fell into a glacier and needed to be rescued. Many people would have given up at that point, but Meagan decided to continue. She reached the South Pole forty days later. She had pulled a sled with a tent and all her food behind her through freezing conditions and ice storms."}

In such a culture, leaders make the big decisions and are not often challenged.

The team was happy to be asked. They said they were not used to being told what to do. They preferred more room to take initiative and be creative. When Gabriela told them exactly what she expected, they felt she did not trust them to do their jobs well. They noticed that Gabriela took it personally when they questioned or changed her decisions, and they explained that they had always worked this way."}

Every year, thousands of people try to climb the world's highest mountains or cross entire continents.

Luckily, he makes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he talks with at lunch. But it is not only the first day that is hard.

One idea is that they use their excellent sense of smell and have learnt to recognise the smells of their favourite destinations. Another possibility is that they have learnt to recognise the names of stations they hear in announcements. Either way, metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals."}

This may not sound like much, but it hides two more worrying trends for society and the environment. First, a big part of this spending is put on credit cards. People in Britain now owe credit card companies about £670 for each adult. This is 66 percent of the average clothing budget. Also, people are not only spending money they do not have; they are also using it to buy things they do not need. The UK throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year, and most of it ends up in landfill sites."}

A business model that has quickly become very common involves companies. These companies provide an online platform that connects customers with people who can give a certain product or service. Companies like Airbnb act as a link for people. They help people earn money from their empty rooms and houses. These can be rented out as places to stay that bring in money. Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own personal cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time."}

In the wild, some of the rarest animals have trouble finding a mate and having young. They also face danger from poachers (illegal hunters), loss of habitat, and predators. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have young. When wild populations get smaller, the risk grows that animals become too closely related. Breeding programs are a safety plan: animals bred in zoos can be released back into the wild to keep a healthy mix of genes."}

With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boats, it's the very large weight they have that can bring about the fall, even if they are going very slowly when it occurs. The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can find structural weakness, safer workplaces and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents."}

When we are awake, our thoughts usually come as words in our head, like conversations we have with ourselves. But when we sleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active. At the same time, the part that controls our emotions becomes more active."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "Having good relationships is a big part of being happy. In one study, most happy people were seen to have strong ties to friends and family. They made sure they spent time with them regularly. You also need at least one person who you discuss personal feelings with – called 'self-disclosure'. Just one person for a heart-to-heart is enough, together with a network of other relationships. It's not enough to have lots of friends just to do things with or chat to about music or football. That deeper connection is all-important. Some people need to learn how to listen well to others in order to develop stronger relationships."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Psychologist Carol Dweck believes in the 'Growth Mindset.' She talked about how our brains can change and how we can develop skills and talents that we were not good at in the beginning. Many of us like to praise the final result and natural talents. For example, we say 'You really have an eye for details' or 'You have a real talent for organizing events.' However, research shows something different. When we focus on the process - how things are done - we can help people develop new skills better. This means we should praise effort, trying new things, and problem-solving strategies. This way, people can keep improving their talents and learning new skills."}

The problems were a bit too difficult for them. One group reacted positively. They said they loved challenges and understood that they could develop their abilities. She says these children had a 'Growth Mindset'. They focused on what they could achieve in the future. But another group of children felt that their intelligence was being judged and that they had failed. They had a 'Fixed Mindset' and couldn't imagine getting better. Some of these children said they might cheat in the future. Others looked for someone who had done worse than them to feel better about themselves."}

What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's also that they are so quiet, which can be very scary too. Of course, empty places are also handy for horror film directors in that it's easier to believe that you will have no phone coverage there either."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified": "In horror movies, the basement is always a very scary place, no matter what kind of house it is.

How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing homework when they see their parents posting on social media while cooking dinner or waiting at a red traffic light? She also made a good point about people who want to be in two or more places at the same time. So they switch back and forth between their real conversations and online conversations. I see this all the time with my teenage daughter and her friends. They make plans to meet and then sit together silently while each one has a different conversation online."}

Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but countries are mostly living together more calmly than in the past. However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, the numbers are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely to be a result of violent crime than political conflict, the global murder rate fell slightly, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}

But once too often they have been left with nothing when such programs have stopped running. Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself. So she brought together two of her passions, mountaineering and human rights, in order to try and change attitudes towards women in her country. She at first took up climbing while working on aid efforts in Tibet and Nepal. In a coastal, primarily flat country like Bangladesh, most people have never set eyes on a mountain. Her effort seems to be doing the trick as other men and women in her country are sitting up and taking notice along with the rest of the world."}

But surprisingly, this is far from the truth. The reality is, however, that a big change is happening. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their income and left poverty behind. Also, six million fewer children die from diseases each year, millions more girls go to school, and millions of people have access to clean water."}

However, when feedback becomes this kind of routine, employees may start to see positive feedback as just a way to make the negative parts seem less bad. This makes the positive feedback less valuable. Instead, positive feedback should not just be used to soften negative comments. It should be given in a way that strengthens and encourages good performance."}

Instead, think about what is happening now: military machines like drones, gun turrets, and sentry robots already kill with very little human control. The next step will be robots called 'murderbots'. These 'murderbots' will follow orders, but they will choose who to kill by themselves. I believe this is completely wrong and dangerous for all people. We must be very careful about what we ask machines to do."}

You know how the feedback sandwich works: first, say something nice, then say what you really want to say, and finally say something nice again."}
{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "'Born in the USA' is a fast, energetic rock album. The lyrics also show deep emotion. Behind the catchy rock melodies, there are stories about the darker side of the American dream. Many songs talk about hardworking, ordinary people who feel bitter and angry when they do not find wealth or fame. For example, 'Glory Days' is about people in a small town who look back on their youth, when they felt the world was at their feet. 'Downbound Train' tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined after he loses his job. It is easy to imagine that the artist is writing about real people he knows. He might even be describing the life he would have had if he had not become a star. The album shows that the Boss has a unique and outstanding talent."}

In the shallow waters of the Red Sea, he saw places like underwater deserts: no life, covered with plastic. He believes that nature can heal if we give it space, but time is running out. If we do not start to care for our seas, we may soon face a problem we cannot solve."}

Luckily, she used this knowledge only to write her novels.

But in his book, Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at how humans have made progress. He finds good news. He says that we now live longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. Pinker says the real problem is that people are attacking important ideas like reason and science. These ideas come from the Enlightenment. When people who speak in public try to make others feel divided, hopeless, or not trusting, then important systems can be badly hurt. These important systems include democracy and countries working together."}

Mobile phones have made that situation a bit harder to believe now. What's the solution to maintain tension? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror film, it's almost certain this will happen at a key moment, just when you absolutely need to call for help. You will not have any coverage at all. Or your phone battery will die just as you are making the call. Or both."}

Now the same thing is happening again to the type that came after it—the Cavendish. The Gros Michel was the main banana on Central American plantations because its fruit was easy to transport, had thick skins, and tasted sweet. United Fruit, the leading grower and exporter in South America at that time, produced bananas very efficiently and on a large scale. Instead of growing plants from seeds, the company made copies of plants by taking shoots from the stems and grew them in fields planted very close together."}

In fact, only 25 types of spiders that we know about make poison that can hurt people, and spider bites can be painful, but they almost never kill people. In Australia, the famous funnel-web spider from Sydney has caused no deaths since a medicine against the poison (antivenom) was made in 1981. However, take care not to stroke or handle spiders that are covered with hair, like the big spiders called tarantulas, in a way they do not like. When they feel in danger, they protect themselves by shooting out a cloud of tiny, itchy hairs. These itchy hairs then stick in the skin or eyes of the attacker."}

It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the strongest and most capable person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "To understand how we developed complex language, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This is not just about brain size. It is also important what our brains can do, and when and why they changed. We have very few physical clues for this. Old objects left by our ancestors do not tell us what kind of speech they could make. However, one thing we can see in the remains of early humans is how their mouth, throat, and tongue developed. By about 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans communicated with more basic sounds."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models young people see doing science-connected jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, very smart creator, or brave astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate belief that scientists are not cool, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and separate from the rest of the world. These are false fixed ideas shown by news and TV, but they may mean girls do not feel close to scientists, and see science as an unattractive career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}

But people under 20 are different. They are so busy communicating that they never feel what it is like to be alone, and they may not learn to enjoy their own company. They also learn to talk through messages that you can edit and change. This hurts the skill of real, face-to-face conversation with the person sitting in front of you."}

If positive and negative feedback always seem to come together, the positive feedback might lose its value and be ignored. Make sure there are times when positive feedback is given just for being positive, and try not to offer any constructive criticism then."}
