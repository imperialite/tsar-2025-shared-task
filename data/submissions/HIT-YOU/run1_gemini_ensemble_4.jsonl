{"text_id":"21-a2","simplified":"Your dreams might tell you about thoughts you don't know you have. Common dreams like flying, falling, losing teeth, or being naked in public places mean similar things for most people. But to really understand what these dreams mean for you, you need to connect them with things and feelings from your daily life."}
{"text_id":"22-a2","simplified":"One of the most interesting examples of wild animals in a city is the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, about 35,000 dogs live on the streets. Some dogs were born wild, and others were once pets but were left by their owners. Some dogs live alone, and some live in packs. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted well to city life. They know it is safer to cross the street with people, and some dogs seem to understand traffic lights."}
{"text_id":"23-a2","simplified":"Wonder is the first novel by RJ Palacio. She is from New York. On her website, she says the idea came after she saw a girl on the street whose face looked different. Wonder is a bestseller in the United States. It has won several awards. Many schools use the book to start talks about bullying, friendship, and being different. People are making a film of the book. Many people, like me, want to see what RJ Palacio writes next."}
{"text_id":"24-a2","simplified":"Chloe has two pet rats. Their names are Zena and Roxy. She knows they are not usual pets. She often tells people that rats are not dirty and can be wonderful pets if you care for them correctly. She understands why some people do not like rats. She also did not like them before her friend Martin showed her his pet rats. She saw they were affectionate and intelligent. Last year, one of Martin's rats had babies, and Chloe decided to have two of them."}
{"text_id":"25-a2","simplified":"Cape Town can be dangerous for baboons. Cars hit some baboons, and they get hurt or die. Other baboons touch power cables and get a bad electric shock. Baboons are endangered. There are not many left. To help them and reduce problems with people, the city hired a team called Baboon Monitors. The monitors keep baboons out of the city. They chase them away or catch them and take them to the countryside. This plan works sometimes. But baboons still come back to the city when they find easy food."}
{"text_id":"26-a2","simplified":"I work for a global IT company. Their head office is in the United States, so I do all my work online from home. I do not waste time traveling or talking too much with colleagues. I work on different projects, and this flexible schedule is helpful. If my children have a school event or I have a dentist appointment, I can take time off. The problem is that I do not have set work hours, so I often work late into the evening. Sometimes I even skip dinner to finish my work."}
{"text_id":"27-a2","simplified":"In the 1990s, graffiti continued. Street art became very popular around the world. Some artists wanted to share political ideas. They made art to make people think about war, unfairness, and unfair treatment. Other artists wanted to make beautiful art. In South America, many street artists worked in poor areas. They painted grey city walls. They added color, life, and beauty."}
{"text_id":"28-a2","simplified":"Social media, magazines, and shop windows show many things to buy every day. As a result, people in Britain are buying more clothes and shoes than ever before. Online shopping makes it easy to buy without thinking. Many big brands sell clothes at very low prices, so people treat them like things they can throw away. They wear these clothes two or three times, then throw them out."}
{"text_id":"29-a2","simplified":"Sam squints his eyes and sees dust far away in the sun. A car is driving to the big house, and the dust goes up. The horses kick and swing their tails to chase flies. They do not care about the owner. The owner has not come for ten months. This is his first time back. Sam is waiting. Mr. Carter does not want to come here. He comes only when he has to. Sam thinks this is good. If he sees the boss less, he can keep his job longer. Mr. Carter wipes the sweat from the back of his neck. There is a big wet spot on his shirt. The June sun is very hot, and his skin is a little red. He usually stays inside to make money and tells other people to do the work, so his skin is not in the sun much."}
{"text_id":"30-a2","simplified":"Many people in Berlin, Germany said shooting pigs was too cruel. Hunters and animal lovers had big arguments about this. The city listened to the complaints. The city council decided to try peaceful ways to stop the pigs. They built fences instead of shooting the pigs. They also made a law that people cannot feed the pigs. We do not know if this will work. It might be difficult because winters are warmer now. This means there are more pigs than before."}
{"text_id":"31-a2","simplified":"Suzanne Collins loves old Greek myths. This love gave her ideas for The Hunger Games. When she was a child, her favorite story was Theseus and the Minotaur. In that story, Crete rules the city of Athens. The people of Athens fight back. As a punishment, King Minos makes them send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The young people are thrown into a maze. A monster called the Minotaur lives there and eats them. But one young man, Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a future Theseus."}
{"text_id":"32-a2","simplified":"Zoos bring people and animals together. They teach us about saving animals and inspire us to protect them and their homes. Some zoos also give a safe place to animals that were hurt in circuses or left by their owners. Zoos do important research about animal behavior and how to treat sick animals."}
{"text_id":"33-a2","simplified":"There is a new idea that says we should not buy too many things. It is called “Buy Nothing.” It started in Canada in the early 1990s. Later it came to the United States. In the U.S., people use it to say no to Black Friday and Cyber Monday on Thanksgiving weekend. These are big shopping days. Many people spend too much money then and buy too many things. On Buy Nothing Day, people join protests. Some people even cut up their credit cards. During the year, Buy Nothing groups also have events to trade and fix things. People bring things they already have to trade or to fix."}
{"text_id":"34-a2","simplified":"Is graffiti art or vandalism? Different people have different ideas. In many countries, the law says that writing or painting on public or private property is vandalism. Many street artists are stopped by the police. Some must pay a fine. Many city councils say it costs a lot of money to clean graffiti from buildings, buses, and trains."}
{"text_id":"35-a2","simplified":"What do people in the art world think about graffiti and street art? Today, more people say it is real art. There were big street art shows in galleries in Paris, London, and Los Angeles. In 2008, the American artist Elura Emerald organized a street art show at a gallery in New York. She defended street artists. She said they only express themselves and do not hurt anyone. She said we should enjoy and celebrate them."}
{"text_id":"36-a2","simplified":"Most people dream four to six times every night after they are ten years old. This means 2,000 dreams each year. So, by the time they are 80, a person might have had 140,000 dreams. We forget almost all our dreams, 95-99 percent of them. But we still remember a few thousand dreams in our life. It is easy to think that a dream can be like a real event later, just by chance. This is especially true if the dream is about things that happen often in everyday life."}
{"text_id":"37-a2","simplified":"The Hunger Games story is set in the future. North America was destroyed. The country is now called Panem. It has twelve poor districts. A rich city, the Capitol, rules them. The Capitol controls everything. Each district makes different things for the Capitol. The story starts in District 12. This district provides all the coal for the country. There was a District 13 before. But they fought the Capitol, so they were destroyed."}
{"text_id":"38-a2","simplified":"Wild animals often come into cities to find food. In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons come into neighborhoods near the edge of the city to eat. They open trash cans and eat fruit from gardens and fruit trees. Some brave baboons even go into people’s houses and take food from kitchen cupboards and fridges. Baboons can be dangerous. They have attacked many pet animals. So many people in the city do not want them there."}
{"text_id":"39-a2","simplified":"Many bridge accidents happen when people are building the bridge. These accidents often happen because engineers make mistakes, like wrong math. The bridge falls down because it is too heavy for itself. This can kill the workers who are on the bridge when it falls."}
{"text_id":"40-a2","simplified":"George Lucas was one of the first film directors to use the 17 steps of the “hero’s journey” to make his story. Usually, the hero lives a normal life. Then something happens and calls the hero to an adventure. This adventure changes everything. At the start of Star Wars, Luke lives a normal life with his aunt and uncle. He repairs robots. He finds a message from Princess Leia to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2-D2. This message is the “call to adventure.” It starts Luke’s journey."}
{"text_id":"41-a2","simplified":"Another idea to stop a space rock that may hit Earth is to blow it up with a nuclear weapon. This sounds like a movie story. It was in the 1998 film Armageddon. But HAMMER is a real NASA plan. In this plan, eight-ton rockets fly at the asteroid and try to push it off its course. If the asteroid is too close to Earth, the rockets carry nuclear bombs and blow it up instead."}
{"text_id":"42-a2","simplified":"Campbell says the hero first says no to the adventure. Then a mentor comes and helps the hero. The hero decides to go and enters a special world where the adventure happens. In this world, the hero takes tests, fights enemies, and meets friends. The hero gets ready for the biggest challenge. For Luke, the mentor is Obi-Wan. His friends are Han Solo and the robots R2-D2 and C-3PO. His enemy is Darth Vader, inside the special world called the Death Star."}
{"text_id":"43-a2","simplified":"Some things do not get used much and seem useless, but other people can still use them. Now that many people use the internet, they have found a way to earn money by sharing these items. They use websites and social media groups to buy and sell second-hand things. It is now much easier for people to share with each other. This is called the sharing economy."}
{"text_id":"44-a2","simplified":"In the 1700s and 1800s, two main ideas about dreams became popular. The first idea says that dreams show things our awake mind cannot see. Freud said that if we understand our dreams, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. The second idea is the opposite. It says that dreams are only brain activity without order while the brain sorts memories and things from the day. When we wake up, we try to understand these mixed images and feelings and make a story from them."}
{"text_id":"45-a2","simplified":"I am a freelancer. I work for myself. This is great because I can choose what I do and how I use my time. At first, I worked at home, but I could not focus. There were many distractions: housework, another cup of tea, and my family asking for my attention. Then I went to a nearby cafe to work, but the internet was slow and I drank too much coffee. In the end, I rented a desk in a shared office with five other people who also work for themselves. I liked getting dressed in the morning and going to work. In the office, I could focus."}
{"text_id":"46-a2","simplified":"NASA needs money to build NEOCam, a 0.5-meter space telescope that uses infrared light to find asteroids. If NASA gets this funding, it can discover the remaining middle-sized near-Earth objects in about ten years. After it identifies these asteroids, the planetary defense team must still plan how to protect Earth from the most dangerous asteroids, called PHAs."}
{"text_id":"47-a2","simplified":"The “buy nothing” idea is now popular with famous people on social media. They usually post clothes and make-up to buy. Now some YouTube stars tell their fans not to buy anything for up to a year. Two friends in Canada tried to buy only food for one year. In the first three months, they did not buy electronics, clothes, or home items. Next, they gave up services. They did not get haircuts. They did not eat at restaurants. They did not buy gas for their cars. After one year, they saved $55,000."}
{"text_id":"48-a2","simplified":"Religion is important to Pi. His family is Hindu. But Pi wants to learn about other religions. He makes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker. Everyone is surprised. Pi says he is Hindu, Muslim, and Christian. His family and teachers ask him to choose one religion. Pi says no. He says, 'I just want to love God.' After that, his family and teachers let him choose his own religion."}
{"text_id":"49-a2","simplified":"Some people think that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. A lucid dream is when you know you are dreaming, and you can change what happens. For example, you can make a scary dream feel safe, or you can control the story like a movie director. Then you are not just looking for the meaning of your dreams, but you are creating them. However, you might still want some dreams to happen naturally, so your subconscious can show you what is on your mind."}
{"text_id":"50-a2","simplified":"Many people donate their unwanted clothes to charity and think they help. They do not see they are part of the problem with clothes we throw away. Charity shops cannot sell all the donated clothes. Fast fashion goes out of style very fast. It is often poor quality, and it is hard to recycle. People do not want to buy it second-hand. Many clothes are thrown away. Charities send many unsold clothes to other countries. This causes more money problems and more problems for the environment there."}
{"text_id":"51-a2","simplified":"Some adventurers like to do one challenge, then another. Meagan McGrath is from Canada. She climbed the highest mountain on each continent. She rode a bike across Canada. She ran a very long race in the Sahara Desert in 45 degrees heat. Her biggest trip was a ski trip to the South Pole. On the first day, she fell into a glacier, a big river of ice, and rescuers saved her. Many people would stop, but Meagan continued. She reached the South Pole 40 days later. She pulled a sledge with a tent and all her food behind her. The weather was very cold, with ice storms."}

{"text_id":"53-a2","simplified":"In some places, councils try to stop random graffiti on walls. They give artists special places to paint. Taiwan is one of these places. It has “graffiti zones” where artists can paint and write on walls. In São Paulo, Brazil, the city council even lets some graffiti artists paint on the subway trains."}
{"text_id":"54-a2","simplified":"Faith47 is from Cape Town in South Africa. She paints big, colorful pictures of people and animals. She likes to explore different places. You can see her art on pavements, in empty factories, and on abandoned cars. She likes that street art does not last forever. The weather or city cleaners will remove it. This reminds her that life always changes, with endings and new beginnings."}
{"text_id":"55-a2","simplified":"Gabriela used to work in a place with high power distance. People respected the boss’s power. Everyone knew their place. Leaders made the big decisions, and people did not question them. Her Swedish team was used to low power distance. Workers and bosses solved problems together. They made decisions as a team. Leaders acted like coaches or guides. They asked people to think for themselves. They accepted questions and disagreement."}
{"text_id":"56-a2","simplified":"When Gabriela saw that she and her team had different cultures, she decided to talk with them. She asked how they felt about how she leads. The team was happy to share their thoughts. They said they were not used to being told what to do. They liked to have freedom to make their own choices and be creative. When Gabriela told them exactly what to do, they felt she did not trust them to do their jobs well. They also saw that Gabriela felt hurt when they disagreed or tried to change her decisions. They explained that this was their normal way of working."}
{"text_id":"57-a2","simplified":"Os Gêmeos are twin brothers from São Paulo. They are exactly the same. They paint many things - small writing and big, colorful pictures of people on walls of buildings. Their paintings are very big, so they need special machines called cranes to help them paint high up. In 2007, they painted all over a castle in Scotland."}
{"text_id":"58-a2","simplified":"People have painted and written on walls for a very long time. In prehistoric times, people in Africa and Europe painted pictures of animals and people inside caves. Graffiti also appears on old buildings in Greece, Italy, Syria, and Iraq. In the Roman town of Pompeii, archaeologists found many examples of graffiti written in Latin. These messages talk about religion, politics, love, and even magic spells."}
{"text_id":"59-a2","simplified":"Have you ever dreamed of climbing Mount Everest or walking to the South Pole? Many people share this dream. Every year, thousands of people try to climb the world’s highest mountains or walk across continents. Long ago, explorers used maps and compasses, but today’s adventurers use modern tools like GPS and satellite phones. Many adventurers love nature and use their trips to teach people about environmental problems, while others want to help people in need and raise money for charities."}

She hunts in the woods near District 12 with her friend Gale and becomes very good with a bow and arrow. When her younger sister, Prim, is chosen as a tribute, Katniss offers to go instead. A boy named Peeta is the other tribute from District 12, and Katniss soon finds their relationship difficult."}
{"text_id":"62-a2","simplified":"Writing about your dreams helps you remember more details. Think about the people and places in the dream because they can add meaning. After a week, you will be surprised by how much you have written. Then you can connect your dreams to events and feelings in your daily life."}
{"text_id":"63-a2","simplified":"In the past, people built many bridges from wood. Wood bridges burned easily. Old train bridges had this problem a lot. Sparks from steel wheels on steel tracks sometimes started fires. These sparks could make a bridge catch fire and burn down."}
{"text_id":"64-a2","simplified":"We cannot know how street art will change. But we can see some trends. Most street artists are young. They paint in their own city or neighbourhood. More artists now travel and work around the world. Other artists use the internet to talk and share photos of their art. The art world now gives street art more respect and sees it as real art. We do not know the future, but we are sure street art will stay."}
{"text_id":"65-a2","simplified":"Suzanne Collines always felt upset when she watched war news. When she was a child, her father was a pilot in the US Air Force. He fought in the Vietnam War.

{"text_id":"68-a2","simplified":"Online marketplaces give everyone a simple way to make some extra money. For example, busy parents used to skip selling old baby items at street markets. Now, they can sell baby clothes their children have outgrown and expensive strollers they no longer need. This helps them put a bit of cash back into their pockets."}
{"text_id":"69-a2","simplified":"Pi and Richard Parker spend 227 days on a lifeboat. They face hunger, illness, and exhaustion. They also endure violent storms and the hot sun, but they survive. Sometimes Pi finds comfort in his three religions, and other times he feels lonely and sad. One day, they see the Mexican coast, and everything changes. You must read the book to find out what happens when they reach land."}
{"text_id":"70-a2","simplified":"Chloe came home from school. She made a cup of coffee and took it to her bedroom. She had some homework, but she could do it later.

Chloe also liked this time because she could play with her pet rats."}
{"text_id":"71-a2","simplified":"In 2010, NASA’s team found and recorded 90% of near-Earth asteroids that are 1 km wide. These objects are called NEOs. They can be as big as mountains.

{"text_id":"72-a2","simplified":"Auggie decided to go to school. He started his first day. He felt very nervous, like any new student. Because his face looked different, the day was very hard. No one wanted to sit next to him. He saw kids stare at him. He heard kids whisper about him. Luckily, he made two friends: Jack from his class and Summer at lunch. The first day was not the only hard day. Soon he learned that some classmates did not want to touch him. They were afraid they could catch “the plague.” During the year, he had good days and bad days. Then a sudden, very bad event at a school camp changed everything."}
{"text_id":"73-a2","simplified":"The two men looked at the north end of the land. The land went very far. They could almost not see the fences from where they stood. A teenage boy who felt bored and angry could not escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest horse. It kicked the ground with its heavy hooves. Sam wondered if the boy could ride. A good rider could get into a lot of trouble out here, far from other people. A boy who cannot ride could get into even more trouble if he tries to get away from his father."}
{"text_id":"74-a2","simplified":"More than four thousand people have climbed Mount Everest. They were between thirteen and eighty years old. Climbing in cold weather and strong storms is very dangerous. However, the best climbers in the world now look for new challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner is from Austria. She started to love climbing when she was a teenager. After she left school, she became a nurse, but she continued to climb in her free time."}
{"text_id":"75-a2","simplified":"Gerlinde climbed Everest. After that, she decided to climb all fourteen 8,000-metre mountains in the world. She wants a bigger challenge. She climbs without oxygen tanks. This is risky. Low oxygen at the top of high mountains can hurt the brain and the body. Gerlinde uses her fame to support a charity. The charity helps poor children and orphans in Nepal."}
{"text_id":"76-a2","simplified":"When we look at the things we bought, we see that we do not use many of them well. For example, we bought a thick wool coat because it looked cool, but we live in a hot country. We put the old smartphone away when we got a new one. We use the car only on the weekends. We turned the guest room into a storage room."}
{"text_id":"77-a2","simplified":"People have believed dreams can predict the future for a long time. They thought gods sent dreams to give knowledge or insight. Even now, many people remember dreaming about an event, place, or person, and later seeing it happen in real life."}
{"text_id":"78-a2","simplified":"Some of the biggest and most expensive transport projects in the world are bridges. Bridges are important. They let cars, trucks, and trains cross rivers and valleys. They can also go over other roads. So bridges are a very important part of building roads and train lines. People check bridges carefully, especially after a bridge falls down."}
{"text_id":"79-a2","simplified":"Gabriela felt frustrated for weeks. She emailed her Swedish manager about problems with her team.

Some dogs even use the city metro to go from one place to another. Scientists do not know how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that dogs use their strong sense of smell. They know the smells of their favorite places. Another idea is that dogs know the station names they hear on the speaker. Either way, passengers are now used to dogs on the trains. Most local people do not notice them."}

After two years and four months, he reached the river’s mouth in Brazil. He walked 6,000 kilometres. The Amazon rainforest has poisonous snakes, crocodiles and jaguars, so he was always in danger. He was lucky to survive with only thousands of mosquito and ant bites."}
{"text_id":"82-a2","simplified":"In the UK, people spend more than £1000 on new clothes each year. This is about four percent of the money they earn. This sounds like a small amount, but it creates two big problems for our society and the environment. First, many people use credit cards to buy these clothes. Now, every adult in the UK owes about £670 to credit card companies. This is 66% of the money they spend on clothes. Also, people buy clothes with money they don't have. And they buy things they don't need. The UK throws away 300,000 tons of clothes every year. Most of these clothes go to rubbish dumps."}
{"text_id":"83-a2","simplified":"Ed could not finish his walk without technology. He used a radio to ask people in the rainforest for food and permission to cross their land. Many people met him and guided him through the hardest areas. While he walked, Ed wrote a blog about his daily experiences. He used media attention to protest against destroying the rainforest and to raise money for environmental and children’s charities in Brazil and Peru."}
{"text_id":"84-a2","simplified":"Many businesses see that sharing can make money. They want to use things that people are not using. One popular model is this: a company makes a website or app. The app connects customers with people who offer a product or a service. Airbnb is one example. It is a middleman. It helps people rent out empty rooms or homes to guests and earn money. Uber is another example. It lets people use their own cars as taxis. Drivers can make extra money in their free time."}
{"text_id":"85-a2","simplified":"Zoos help endangered animals with international breeding programs. Some rare animals cannot find mates in the wild, and they face threats from hunters, loss of habitat, or predators. Zoos give them a safe place to live and have babies. When numbers of certain animals get too low, they can become too genetically similar. Breeding programs protect them by releasing zoo-born animals into the wild to increase genetic variety."}
{"text_id":"86-a2","simplified":"Boat and train accidents with bridges are very rare. But boats and trains can make a bridge fall for different reasons. A train can make a bridge fall if it hits the bridge at high speed. A boat can make a bridge fall because it is very heavy, even when it moves very slowly. We can stop bridges from falling if we plan for this. New tools can find weak parts in a bridge. Safer workplaces and better bridge designs can also help stop these terrible accidents."}
{"text_id":"87-a2","simplified":"At first, Pi is very scared of the animals. He jumps into the ocean. Then he remembers that hungry sharks are in the water around him. He climbs back into the lifeboat. In the lifeboat, the animals kill and eat each other, one by one, until only Pi and the tiger are left. Pi names the tiger Richard Parker. Lucky for Pi, the tiger feels sick on the boat and does not want to eat him right away."}
{"text_id":"88-a2","simplified":"When Pi is 16, a new government takes power, but his parents do not support it. They worry about the future, so they close their zoo and move to Canada. They sell some of the animals to zoos in North America. Pi and his family travel by ship with the remaining animals. A strong storm hits, and the ship sinks. Pi’s family and the sailors drown, but Pi survives. He finds a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a huge tiger."}

{"text_id":"90-a2","simplified":"Dreams might be our brain organizing thoughts from the day, but in dreams these thoughts become symbols. When we are awake, our thoughts are mostly words in our head, like we are talking to ourselves. But when we sleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active, and the part that controls emotions becomes more active."}
{"text_id":"91-a2","simplified":"Good relationships with people are very important for happiness. In one study, most happy people had strong connections with friends and family. They spent time with them regularly. You also need at least one person you can talk to about your personal feelings. This is called self-disclosure. You only need one person you can share your secrets with, plus other friends. It is not enough to just have many friends to do activities with or talk about music and sports. That deeper connection is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen well to others so they can build stronger relationships."}
{"text_id":"92-a2","simplified":"Carol Dweck, a psychologist who studies “growth mindset,” says the brain can change. We can learn new skills or talents even if we are not good at them at first. Many people praise only the final result, for example, “You notice details well” or “You are good at organizing events.” But studies show that focusing on how we do things—praising effort, trying new methods, and finding solutions—helps us develop new skills and improve our talents."}
{"text_id":"93-a2","simplified":"The rover checks the air regularly. In 2014, it found methane, which is a simple organic molecule and an important part of natural gas.

The amount of methane goes up and down each season, almost like Mars is breathing."}
{"text_id":"94-a2","simplified":"Professor Dweck, a psychologist at Stanford University, gave some ten-year-old children difficult problems when she started her work. One group of children were very positive. They liked challenges and knew they could get better. Professor Dweck called this a 'growth mindset.' These children thought about what they could learn and do in the future. But the other group of children felt people were judging them and thought they failed. This was a 'fixed mindset.' They thought they could not get better. Some children said they might cheat later. Other children would look for people who did worse than them. This made them feel better."}
{"text_id":"95-a2","simplified":"Horror movies like empty places where no one lives. This can be an old hospital, a scary empty house, or a ghost town. Lonely, empty places have something special about them. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's because these places are too quiet, and that's scary too. Empty places are also useful for horror movie directors because there is no phone signal there, which makes the story more believable."}
{"text_id":"96-a2","simplified":"In horror movies, basements are always scary places. Often, something is hidden there, or bad people hide their tools. Basements are always dark, and they are often wet. There is only a small, narrow stairs to go down. Basements are always scary, even if there is nothing inside."}
{"text_id":"97-a2","simplified":"Gary Collins was a police officer. He was not at work. He watched the London riots on TV. He quickly saw some people he knew. He did not finish his holiday. He went to help the police. He watched many videos for six months. He found 190 people. He knew many people just from their eyes. His help was very important for the police work. There were 200,000 hours of video. But a computer program only found one person."}
{"text_id":"98-a2","simplified":"I think it is very interesting. We can help humans change faster by changing our bodies. Imagine putting a computer in our brain! Soon, we can do that. Then we can be better at math, see better, hear better, and remember better. This idea will become more common."}
{"text_id":"99-a2","simplified":"This was a very interesting talk. The speaker is right. Parents have a big influence. How can we expect teens not to send messages when they do homework? They see their parents go online while cooking dinner or waiting at a red light. She also said another true thing: many people want to be in two places at the same time. So they talk to people near them, then a moment later they chat online. I often see this with my teenage daughter and her friends. They meet, then they sit together and do not talk. Each person is online, chatting with other people."}
{"text_id":"100-a2","simplified":"Some news stories make us think the world is getting more violent. But there is some good news too. From the end of World War II to 1990, there were 30 wars. Each of these wars killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but most countries live more peacefully than before. Terrorism has increased a lot in the last few years. Since World War II, wars have killed more civilians than soldiers. Even so, not all the numbers are bad for civilians. People are about nine times more likely to die from violent crime than from political conflict. The global murder rate went down a little. It was 8 per 100,000 people in 2000. It was about 5.3 in 2015."}
{"text_id":"101-a2","simplified":"Wasfia has spent her life supporting human rights. She saw many charity projects in Bangladesh that helped women and girls learn new skills. But when the projects stopped, these women and girls lost their support. Wasfia wanted Bangladesh to stand up for itself. She brought together her love of mountain climbing and her passion for human rights to change how people see women in her country. She first learned climbing while working in Tibet and Nepal. In Bangladesh, most people have never seen a mountain because it is a flat, coastal country. Her campaign is working, and many people in Bangladesh and around the world are now paying attention."}
{"text_id":"102-a2","simplified":"Most people think that developing countries are in a very bad situation. They think people suffer from extreme poverty. They think dictators control these countries. They think there is little hope for change. But this is not true. A big change is happening. In the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their income and left poverty. Every year, six million fewer children die from disease. Millions more girls go to school. Millions more people have clean water."}
{"text_id":"103-a2","simplified":"Many managers place negative feedback between two positive comments. However, if they do this too often, employees may think the positive comments simply hide the negatives. Managers should give positive feedback to support and encourage good work, not just to soften criticism."}
{"text_id":"104-a2","simplified":"I belong to a group that wants to stop killer robots. Do not only imagine scary movie robots like the Terminator. Today, the military already uses drones, gun turrets, and sentry robots that kill with little human control. The next step is autonomous “murderbots.” They follow orders but decide who to kill on their own. I believe this is wrong and dangerous for everyone. We must be careful about what tasks we allow machines to do."}
{"text_id":"105-a2","simplified":"More people learn English than all other languages together. English is also spoken in more countries than any other language. But Chinese has the most native speakers by far. There is no clear connection between how many native speakers a language has and how many people learn it. However, there is a stronger connection between the number of learners and how many countries speak that language."}
{"text_id":"106-a2","simplified":"Your manager stops you. She says she needs to talk about your work on the recent project. You worry all weekend. You think you did something wrong. On Monday morning, you go to her office. She begins by saying you did a good job on the project. You wonder if this is the usual “feedback sandwich.” You know this way: say something nice, say the real problem, say something nice again."}
{"text_id":"107-a2","simplified":"“Born in the U.S.A.” is a fast rock album. It makes you want to clap and tap your foot. But the words have strong feelings. Behind the fun music, there is a story about the hard side of the American Dream. Many songs are about normal people. They work very hard, but they do not get money or become famous. So they feel sad and sometimes angry. “Glory Days” is about people in a small town. They remember their young days. Then they felt they could do anything. “Downbound Train” is about a young man. He loses his job, and his life becomes very bad. It sounds like the singer sings about people he knows. Maybe, if he was not a star, his life would be like theirs. This album shows the singer’s talent. It is special and great."}
{"text_id":"108-a2","simplified":"Lewis wants more parts of the sea to be safe. Now, only a small part (3%) is safe. He wants a bigger part (10%) to be safe. This can help stop problems people cause, like taking too many fish, making the sea dirty, and throwing rubbish. Lewis saw this bad damage when he went on trips. He swam over white coral reefs because the sea water was too warm. He also saw parts of the Red Sea with no plants or animals, only plastic. They looked like deserts under the water. Pugh thinks nature can get better if we give it space. But there is not much time. If we do not care for our seas now, soon we will have a big problem we cannot fix."}
{"text_id":"109-a2","simplified":"Terrie Sharp is a best-selling writer. She tells very good stories. She won the Olive Crime Writer Award two times. She was born in a part of Glasgow with a lot of crime. She learned to keep quiet and stay out of trouble. She even learned to open a car door with a knife. She used this knowledge only to write her books. Now she is not quiet. She is on daytime TV shows, like Police Today. She also talks at writing events around the UK."}
{"text_id":"110-a2","simplified":"Are things getting worse every day? Is progress not possible? In “Enlightenment Now,” Steven Pinker gives us good news: we live longer, stay healthier, and feel more free and happy. But he warns that reason and science are in danger. If people split us into groups, say our future cannot change, or make us lose trust, then we hurt democracy and the way countries work together."}
{"text_id":"111-a2","simplified":"In older horror movies, the main characters often could not call for help or call the police when they were in trouble. Now, mobile phones make that less believable. So, filmmakers usually show no phone signal to keep the tension. If you are a hero in a horror movie, you will almost certainly lose phone coverage right when you need to call for help. Or your phone battery will die at that exact moment. Or both."}
{"text_id":"112-a2","simplified":"In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America had a big problem. Their best-selling banana, the Gros Michel (Big Mike), was dying. Now the same thing is happening to the Cavendish, the banana that came after it. The Gros Michel had thick skin and a sweet taste, and it was easy to send far. It was the main banana on farms in Central America. United Fruit was the main grower in South America then, and it sold bananas to other countries. The company grew bananas in a fast and cheap way. It cut pieces from plant stems to make new plants instead of using seeds. It planted the bananas very close together."}
{"text_id":"113-a2","simplified":"Most spiders have venom. They use it to stun or kill their prey, not to harm people. Only 25 kinds of spiders can hurt humans, and their bites seldom kill. In Australia, the Sydney funnel-web spider is well-known, but no one has died from it since scientists made an anti-venom in 1981. Be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel threatened, they send out tiny irritating hairs into the skin or eyes of whoever attacks them."}
{"text_id":"114-a2","simplified":"This scary movie story was very popular at the end of the 1900s. At the start, a group of young people have fun together. At the end, all people die except one girl. In the beginning, this girl is usually innocent, shy, and not very strong. At the end, she becomes the strongest and smartest person in the world. This last girl almost always wins."}
{"text_id":"115-a2","simplified":"We want to know where our complex language came from. We must look at our brains. Our brains are different from animal brains. This is not just about brain size. We need to know what our brains can do, and when and why they changed. We have few clues about this. Old tools from our ancestors do not tell us how they spoke. But we can see one thing in old human bones: how their mouth, throat, and tongue changed. By 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simple sounds to talk."}
{"text_id":"116-a2","simplified":"People, not nature, tell us that girls should like arts and languages. They tell us that boys should study maths and physics. Children do not see many women who work in science. Cartoons and stories often show the scientist, the very smart inventor, or the brave astronaut as a man. Many people think scientists are nerdy, not good at talking, and lonely. They think science is far from real life. The media gives us these ideas, but they are not true. These ideas can make girls feel that science is not for them. Girls may think science is not interesting or not a good job. If girls see more good examples of women in science, they get more confidence and feel welcome in those subjects."}
{"text_id":"117-a2","simplified":"The Scallion is printed every week. It is free in faculty buildings, and about 10,000 students read it. Students write and produce the newspaper. A survey shows that students and staff enjoy it for fun, culture, and work experience. Printing costs a lot of money. Also, some students cannot easily get the newspaper, because they must go to the university in person. Another problem is that many copies become litter on campus."}
{"text_id":"118-a2","simplified":"At Girox Foods, about 12% of our employees leave each year. This number may not look high, but the industry average is only 7%. The main goal of this report is to find out why our employees are motivated at work and suggest ways to help them feel happier, so they choose to stay with the company."}
{"text_id":"119-a2","simplified":"The speaker is right about many things. I think there is a problem: the more we use phones and the internet to talk to others, the more lonely we feel. For people my age, this is not a big problem. For a long time, we did not have phones and computers. We could be alone, and we knew it was normal.  But people under twenty are different. They are very busy. They chat and send texts all the time. They are not often quiet and alone. They may not learn how to be happy when they are alone. Also, they often use messages that they can change before they send them. So they are not very good at talking face to face with people around them."}
{"text_id":"120-a2","simplified":"Do not always give a negative comment after a good comment. If you always put good and bad comments together, people stop caring about the good ones. The good words can feel less important, and people may ignore them. Sometimes, give only positive feedback. Say what the person did well, and stop there. Try not to add advice every time."}
{"text_id":"21-b1","simplified":"Your dreams might show you all kinds of insights into things that you didn't realise you were thinking about. Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people. But the key to knowing exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."}
{"text_id":"22-b1","simplified":"One of the most interesting cases of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs of Moscow. In Moscow, there are approximately 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets. Some of the dogs were born wild, while others are pets that have been left behind by their owners. Some dogs live alone and others live in packs. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs and discovered that the dogs have adapted very successfully to city life. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people and some dogs appear to understand traffic lights."}

A movie version is being made, and many people, including me, are excited to see what RJ Palacio writes next."}

Chloe knows they're not typical pets and she has lost count of the occasions she's calmly tried to explain to people that rats aren't dirty and they make fantastic pets if you look after them correctly. But she understands why people react badly. She didn't like rats either until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats and she saw how loving and intelligent they were. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she'd like to have two of them."}
{"text_id":"25-b1","simplified":"Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed in car accidents, and others have died from electric shocks when they played with electric cables. Baboons are an endangered species, and to save them and reduce problems between people and baboons, the city council has hired a team of baboon monitors. The monitors' job is to make baboons leave city areas, or to catch them and let them go in the countryside. This plan has had some success, but it's hard to stop the baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a place with easy food."}
{"text_id":"26-b1","simplified":"I work for a global IT company, but because their main office is in the USA, I do all my work online from home. That shows that I don't waste time traveling to work or making empty small talk with workmates. I work on an assignment basis, and this freedom is very valuable to me. It allows me to easily take time off when my children need me at their school shows or if I need to plan a dentist appointment. The drawback is that without clear office hours, I tend to work late into the evening, sometimes missing dinner to finish a task."}
{"text_id":"27-b1","simplified":"In the 1990s, graffiti continued but there was also an explosion in street art around the world. Some artists wanted to make political points and produced art that tried to make people think about war, unfairness and discrimination. Other street artists were more concerned with producing beautiful, attractive work. In South America, many street artists went to work in poor areas adding colour, life and beauty to grey, city walls."}
{"text_id":"28-b1","simplified":"Social media, magazines and shop windows show people daily with things to buy, and British consumers are buying more clothes and shoes than ever before.

{"text_id":"29-b1","simplified":"Sam narrowed his eyes against the sun and looked at the far dust trail kicked up by the car as it drove up to the Big House. The horses kicked and swished their tails at the flies. They did not care that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr Carter only came out here when he had to, and that was fine with Sam. The more he stayed out of his boss’s way, the longer he would keep his job. Mr Carter rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck. The damp spots on his shirt ran together like shapes on a map. His skin was already turning red in the June sun. Otherwise, he had the indoor look of a man who made money while other people did the work."}
{"text_id":"30-b1","simplified":"Many people who live in Berlin, Germany complained that killing pigs with guns was not needed and cruel, and there were heated arguments between hunters and animal lovers. Because of these complaints, the city council decided to act more peacefully against the pigs. Instead of killing them with guns, they put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. Time will tell if this plan works, although it may be a losing battle because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before."}
{"text_id":"31-b1","simplified":"One important inspiration for the book The Hunger Games comes from Suzanne’s love of classical Greek myths. When she was a child, one of her favorite stories was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the Athenians rebel. As punishment, Minos, the king of Crete, forces the people of Athens to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The young people are thrown into a maze called the Labyrinth and are eaten by a monster called the Minotaur that lives there. But one of the young people, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a future version of Theseus."}
{"text_id":"32-b1","simplified":"By bringing people and animals together, zoos have the potential to educate the public about conservation issues and inspire people to protect animals and their habitats. Some zoos provide a safe place for animals which have been badly treated in circuses, or pets which have been left behind. Zoos also carry out important research into subjects like animal behaviour and how to cure illnesses."}
{"text_id":"33-b1","simplified":"In contrast to consumerism, a different trend is emerging: the Buy Nothing trend. The idea started in Canada in the early 1990s and then spread to the USA. There, it became a protest against too much spending and consumption on Black Friday and Cyber Monday during the Thanksgiving weekend. On Buy Nothing Day, people organize different kinds of protests and cut up their credit cards. All year round, Buy Nothing groups organize the exchange and repair of things they already own."}
{"text_id":"34-b1","simplified":"Is graffiti art or vandalism? It depends on your point of view, but in many countries, writing or painting on public or private property is considered vandalism. Many street artists have been stopped by the police, and some had to pay fines. Many city councils complain about the high cost of cleaning graffiti from buildings, buses, and trains."}
{"text_id":"35-b1","simplified":"What does the art world think of graffiti and street art? Recently, there has been more and more understanding of its value as an art form. There have been major exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles. The American artist Elura Emerald organised a street art exhibition at a New York gallery in 2008. She defended street artists. She said that 'artists who paint on the street are just expressing themselves, not hurting anyone'. She also said: 'They should be appreciated and celebrated'."}
{"text_id":"36-b1","simplified":"If most people have four to six dreams every night after the age of ten, that's as many as 2,000 dreams per year. So, by the time they reach 80 years old the average person might have had 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95–99 per cent of our dreams, that's still a few thousand remembered dreams across a person's life. It's not too difficult to believe that, by chance, a dream event is followed by a real-life event that's similar to it, especially if the subject of the dream is something that happens often in everyday life."}
{"text_id":"37-b1","simplified":"The Hunger Games takes place in the future, after the destruction of North America. The country is called Panem and is made up of twelve poor districts governed by the rich Capitol. The Capitol holds absolute power over the nation. Each district is responsible for producing different things for the Capitol. District 12, where the story begins, provides all the coal for the country. There used to be a thirteenth district but they fought back against the Capitol in the past and were destroyed."}
{"text_id":"38-b1","simplified":"Often wild animals come into cities to look for food. In Cape Town, South Africa, large monkeys have started coming into residential areas on the edge of the city to feed. They open rubbish bins and eat fruit from gardens and fruit farms. Some brave large monkeys have even come into people's houses and taken food from kitchen cupboards and fridges! Large monkeys can be aggressive and have attacked a lot of pet animals, so understandably, many city people don't welcome their presence."}
{"text_id":"39-b1","simplified":"A large number of bridge accidents occur during the construction of the bridge itself.

{"text_id":"40-b1","simplified":"George Lucas was one of the early film directors to directly base his story on the 17 stages of the hero's journey. Typically the hero starts the story living an ordinary life, but something happens that calls them to an adventure that changes everything. At the beginning of Star Wars, Luke lives an ordinary life with his aunt and uncle, repairing robots. When he finds Princess Leia's message to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2D2, it is 'the call to adventure' that starts the hero on his journey."}
{"text_id":"41-b1","simplified":"Another way to defend Earth from an asteroid is to blow it up with a nuclear weapon. This idea sounds like a movie plot, like in the 1998 film Armageddon. But HAMMER is a real plan from NASA. HAMMER uses rockets that weigh eight tons. NASA would fire these rockets at an asteroid that is coming. The rockets would try to push the asteroid off its course. If the asteroid is too close to Earth for this, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to destroy it instead."}
{"text_id":"42-b1","simplified":"According to Campbell, the hero first refuses the call to adventure. But then, a mentor appears and helps him. So, the hero decides to 'cross the threshold' and go into the 'special world' where the adventure takes place. The next step is to pass tests, fight enemies, and meet friends. While doing this, the hero prepares to face his biggest challenge. For Luke, the mentor is, of course, Obi-Wan. His friends are Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO. And the enemy is Darth Vader, in the special world of the Death Star."}
{"text_id":"43-b1","simplified":"Underutilised items may seem useless to some, but could be a useful thing to others. With the arrival of the internet, online groups have figured out a way to make money from the sharing of those items that are not used much. Using websites and social online groups that help with the buying and selling of second-hand goods, it is now easier than ever for person-to-person sharing activities to take place. And this is called the sharing economy."}
{"text_id":"44-b1","simplified":"In the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea said that what we see in dreams stands for something hidden from our conscious mind. Freud believed that if we understand our dreams, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. The other idea was the opposite. It said that dreams are just random brain activity while the brain sorts memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these random images and feelings and turn them into a kind of story."}
{"text_id":"45-b1","simplified":"I am a freelancer and work for myself. This is great because I can control what I do and how I spend my time. At first, I worked from home, but I found it really hard to focus. There were too many distractions: housework that needed to be done, making another cup of tea, and my family members who wanted my attention for different things. So I started working in a nearby café, but the internet connection was not good and I noticed I was drinking too much coffee. Finally, I decided to rent a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers like me. I liked getting dressed for work in the morning and being able to focus in an office environment."}
{"text_id":"46-b1","simplified":"Whether NASA can find the remaining medium-sized NEOs depends on whether it gets money to build NEOCam, a 0.5-meter space telescope that would use infrared light to spot asteroids. If NASA receives funding, it can probably reach its goal in ten years. Once the asteroids are found, the planetary defense team must still figure out how to protect Earth from the truly worrying asteroids, called PHAs."}
{"text_id":"47-b1","simplified":"The 'buy nothing' trend has now reached influencers on social media who usually share posts of clothes and make-up that they recommend for people to buy. Some YouTube stars now encourage their watchers not to buy anything at all for periods as long as a year. Two friends in Canada spent a year working towards buying only food. For the first three months they learned how to live without buying electrical goods, clothes or things for the house. For the next stage, they gave up services, for example haircuts, eating out at restaurants or buying petrol for their cars. In one year, they'd saved $55,000."}
{"text_id":"48-b1","simplified":"Religion is important to Pi. Though his family is Hindu, he is curious about other religions and he makes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker. To everyone's surprise, Pi declares himself to be at the same time Hindu, Muslim and Christian. When his family and teachers ask him to choose just one religion, Pi refuses, saying 'I just want to love God'. From that moment, his family and teachers decide to let him make his own mind up about religion."}
{"text_id":"49-b1","simplified":"Some people think writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. In a lucid dream, you know you are dreaming. You can also decide what happens in the dream. For example, you can change a nightmare into a dream that feels safe. Or you can control your dream like a movie director. So, you will create your dreams instead of just trying to understand their meaning. But you might still want to have some dreams where your mind shows you what you are really thinking."}
{"text_id":"50-b1","simplified":"People might not realise they are part of the throwaway clothes problem because they give their unwanted clothes to charities. But charity shops can't sell all those unwanted clothes. 'Fast fashion' goes out of fashion as quickly as it came in and is often too poor quality to recycle; people don't want to buy it second-hand. Huge quantities end up being thrown away, and a lot of clothes that charities can't sell are sent abroad, causing even more economic and environmental problems."}
{"text_id":"51-b1","simplified":"Not happy with one amazing trip, some of today's explorers go from challenge to challenge. Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed the highest mountain on each continent, ridden a bike across Canada and run a long-distance race in the Sahara Desert in 45ºC heat. But perhaps her most remarkable journey was a skiing trip to the South Pole. On the first day, she fell into a crack in the ice and had to be rescued. Many of us would have given up at that point, but Meagan decided to carry on. She reached the South Pole forty days later, having pulled a heavy cart with a tent and all her food behind her through freezing conditions and ice storms."}

{"text_id":"54-b1","simplified":"Faith47 is from Cape Town in South Africa. She paints big, colourful pictures of people and animals and likes to explore different locations. Her work is seen on sidewalks, in empty factories and on left-behind cars. She likes the fact that most street art is temporary and will soon be removed by weather or cleaners from the city council. For her, this reflects how life is full of change with its cycle of endings and new beginnings."}
{"text_id":"55-b1","simplified":"In her previous work place, Gabriela was used to a high power distance culture where power and authority are valued and everyone has their rightful place. In such a culture, leaders make the big decisions and are not often challenged. Her Swedish team, however, were used to working in a low power distance culture where employees often work together with their bosses to find solutions and make decisions. Here, leaders act as coaches or guides who encourage independent thought and expect to be challenged."}
{"text_id":"56-b1","simplified":"When Gabriela became aware of the cultural differences between her and her team, she took action to have an open conversation with them about their feelings about her leadership. Pleased to be asked for their thoughts, Gabriela's team freely expressed that they were not used to being told what to do. They enjoyed having more room for taking action and creative freedom. When she told her team exactly what she needed them to do, they felt that she didn't trust them to do their job well. They realised that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to question or make changes to her decisions, and were able to explain that it was how they'd always worked."}

{"text_id":"58-b1","simplified":"People have been painting and writing on walls throughout history. In very old times, people in Africa and Europe used to paint pictures of animals and people in caves. Graffiti has been seen on buildings at ancient sites in Greece, Italy, Syria and Iraq.

Every year, thousands of people try to climb the world's highest mountains or walk across continents. Different from the travelers of the past who used maps and navigation tools, today's adventure seekers travel with modern technology like satellite navigation and satellite phones. Many adventure seekers are nature lovers who use their travels to help raise awareness about a range of environmental issues, while others are excited to help people who require assistance and raise money for charities."}

This moon, named 'Didymoon,' is 150 meters wide. It moves around its main asteroid, which is 800 meters wide. Hopefully, when DART hits Didymoon, it will move the moon enough from its normal path so that telescopes on Earth can see the change."}

She hunts with her friend Gale in the woods near District 12 and becomes very skilled with a bow and arrow. When her younger sister Prim is chosen to be one of the tributes, Katniss volunteers to take her place. The other tribute from District 12 is a boy named Peeta, and Katniss soon finds herself in a complicated relationship with him."}

{"text_id":"64-b1","simplified":"It is impossible to know how street art will develop in the future but certain trends are emerging. While most street artists are young people who paint in their city or neighbourhood, more and more street artists are travelling and working around the globe. Other artists are using the internet to talk to each other and share photos of their work. Also, the art world is giving more acceptance to street art as a real art form. Although we don't know what will happen to street art in the future, we can be sure that it is here to stay!"}
{"text_id":"65-b1","simplified":"Suzanne Collines has always felt news programmes of wars upsetting. When she was a child, her father was a pilot in the US Air Force and he fought in Vietnam. Her mother tried to protect her by not telling her what was happening in the war. But she still saw news programmes about the war and knew that her dad was there. It was a very frightening experience for her."}
{"text_id":"66-b1","simplified":"In a global survey by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), more than 40,000 answers were collected from Millennials (born between 1983 and 1993) and from people of other ages. The survey asked about workplace culture, communication and ways of working, pay, career growth, work-life balance, and other topics. In a separate global survey by Deloitte, more than 10,000 Millennials took part. They shared their views on the risks and opportunities in today’s complex world of work."}

He's ridden a bike through the deserts of Morocco, kayaked through the Grand Canyon and climbed Everest. Amazingly, Erik has been blind since the age of 13. Apart from his travels, he tries to encourage people with disabilities to live active lives and takes groups of young blind people on climbing trips."}
{"text_id":"68-b1","simplified":"Open online platforms are providing a chance for people to make a quick dollar or two. To give an example, busy parents before might not have tried setting up a stall at the local market or car boot sale to sell their children's old equipment. But with online markets, parents are now able to sell on hardly worn baby clothes their children have outgrown and expensive pushchairs and baby equipment they have invested in. This puts some cash back into their pockets."}
{"text_id":"69-b1","simplified":"Pi and Richard Parker spend 227 days in the rescue boat. They live through hunger, illness and great tiredness. They endure violent storms and the burning heat of the Pacific sun, but somehow they survive. Sometimes, Pi finds comfort in his three religions, but at other moments he is overcome by feeling alone and despair. Finally, the coast of Mexico appears on the horizon and everything changes. It would be a shame to give away the ending. So you will have to read the book yourself to find out what happens to Pi and Richard Parker once land is in sight."}
{"text_id":"70-b1","simplified":"Chloe arrived home from school, made herself a cup of coffee and took it up to her bedroom. She had some homework to do, but that could wait for later. She wanted to enjoy the quiet hour before her parents arrived home and the house filled up with the evening sounds of talking, television or her dad listening to his favorite jazz while he cooked dinner. She liked this time of day too because she could play with her pet rats."}
{"text_id":"71-b1","simplified":"In 2010, a NASA team found and recorded 90% of the large asteroids near Earth. These asteroids are about 1 kilometer wide. They are called 'near-Earth objects' (NEOs). NEOs are as big as mountains, and they fly within 50 million kilometers of Earth. NASA still needs to record information for about 50 more. But NASA says that the 887 NEOs they know about are not a big danger to our planet."}
{"text_id":"72-b1","simplified":"Having decided to go to school, Auggie then has to face his first day. Like every child starting at a new school, he is really anxious. But because of the way he looks, it's a very painful experience. Nobody wants to sit next to him and he notices other kids staring at him or talking about him behind their hands. Fortunately, he makes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he chats with at lunch. But it's not just the first day that's hard. Auggie soon learns that his classmates don't want to touch him for fear of catching 'the disease'. As he goes through the school year, Auggie goes through many intense ups and downs till finally an unexpected and shocking event at a school camp changes things completely."}
{"text_id":"73-b1","simplified":"The two men looked towards the northern end of the property. It stretched as far as the eye could see. Even the fences were barely visible from where they stood. However bored and disobedient a teenage boy might get, it wasn't possible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest of the horses, kicking at the ground with its heavy feet. Could the boy ride? he wondered. There was a whole load of trouble a good person who rides could get into out here, miles away from anyone. But maybe there was even more trouble for someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father."}
{"text_id":"74-b1","simplified":"Over 4,000 climbers, aged from thirteen to eighty have been to the top of Everest. Though climbing high mountains in freezing conditions and violent storms is still extremely dangerous, the world's best climbers now look for new challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria in Europe fell in love with mountain climbing as a teenager. When she left school, she worked as a nurse, but kept climbing in her free time."}
{"text_id":"75-b1","simplified":"Having climbed Everest, Gerlinde decided to climb all fourteen of the world's 8,000 metre mountain tops. To increase the challenge, Gerlinde climbs without using oxygen tanks. This is dangerous as low oxygen levels at the top of high mountains can affect brain and body functioning. Gerlinde uses her popularity as a climber to support a charity for poor children and orphans in Nepal."}
{"text_id":"76-b1","simplified":"If we look around us at the things we have bought at some point in our lives, we would no doubt notice that not everything we own is being put to good use: the thick woollen coat which we thought looked fashionable despite the fact that we live in a tropical country, the smartphone that got put away when we bought ourselves the newest model, the car that only gets used at the weekends, or even the guest room in our house that somehow got turned into a storage room."}
{"text_id":"77-b1","simplified":"Throughout history and across cultures, dreams have been associated with prediction.

Even today, many people can recall a time they dreamed about an event, place or person and then, later, the dream came true in real life."}
{"text_id":"78-b1","simplified":"Some of the world's largest and most expensive transport projects have involved building bridges. Bridges are key connections that carry cars, trucks, and trains over water, deep valleys, or other roads. Because of this, they are one of the most important parts of civil engineering and are carefully checked, especially if they collapse."}
{"text_id":"79-b1","simplified":"After weeks of frustration, Gabriela emailed her manager from Sweden about the issues she was facing with her team. Her manager simply asked her if she felt her team was still performing, and what she thought would help her better work together with her team members. Gabriela thought her manager vague and didn't feel as if he was managing the situation properly."}
{"text_id":"80-b1","simplified":"Dogs that live in packs have learnt that humans are more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs so those dogs are sent to beg for food for the whole pack. Some dogs have even learnt to use the city's underground train system to get from one part of their area to another! Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their excellent sense of smell and have learnt to recognise the smells of their favourite destinations. Another possibility is that they have learnt to recognise the names of stations they hear in announcements. Either way, underground train passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals."}
{"text_id":"81-b1","simplified":"Ed Stafford from the United Kingdom is the first person to walk the length of the Amazon River. He started by a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and arrived at the river's mouth in Brazil, two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres. The Amazon rainforest is home to poisonous snakes, crocodiles and jaguars, so Ed was in non-stop danger. Luckily, he survived with nothing worse than a few thousand mosquito and ant bites."}
{"text_id":"82-b1","simplified":"In the UK, the average person spends over £1,000 each year on new clothes. This is about four percent of their income. This might not sound like a lot, but this number hides two much more worrying trends for society and the environment. First, a lot of this spending happens using credit cards. British people currently owe credit card companies about £670 per adult. That is 66 percent of the average clothing budget. Also, people are not only spending money they don't have, but they are also using it to buy things they don't need. The UK throws away 300,000 tonnes of clothes each year, and most of it ends up in landfills."}
{"text_id":"83-b1","simplified":"Ed's walk would have been impossible without technology. He used a radio to ask the people of the rainforest for food and permission to cross their land. Many of them came to meet him and helped guide him through the most difficult land. As he walked Ed wrote a blog, recording his day-to-day experiences. He used the news interest in his trip to speak out about the destruction of the rainforest and raise money for environmental and children's charities in Brazil and Peru."}
{"text_id":"84-b1","simplified":"Companies have noticed that the sharing economy can be very profitable. They try to make money by using resources that are not fully used. A business model that has quickly become popular involves companies providing an online platform. This platform connects customers with people who can offer a specific product or service. For example, companies like Airbnb act as a middleman. They help people earn money from their empty rooms and houses by letting them rent them out as profitable places to stay. Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own private cars as taxis. This allows them to earn extra money in their free time."}
{"text_id":"85-b1","simplified":"One of the most important modern jobs of zoos is to support international breeding programs, especially for endangered species. In the wild, some of the rarest animals find it hard to find a mate and have young. They also face dangers from poachers (illegal hunters), loss of habitat, and predators. A good zoo gives these species a safe place to live and breed. When the number of wild animals goes down, there is a higher risk that the animals become too similar genetically. Breeding programs help with this. Animals raised in zoos can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity."}
{"text_id":"86-b1","simplified":"Both of these kinds of accidents are extremely rare, but boats and trains can cause a bridge to fall for different reasons. With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boats, it's the very large weight they have that can bring about the fall, even if they are going very slowly when it occurs. The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can find structural weakness, safer working conditions and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents."}
{"text_id":"87-b1","simplified":"At first, Pi is terrified of the animals and jumps into the ocean. Then he remembers that there are hungry dangerous fish in the water around him and realises his only option is to climb back into the small boat. One by one, the animals in the small boat kill and eat each other, till only Pi and the tiger are left. Fortunately for Pi, the tiger, who he names Richard Parker, is sick from the moving boat and has no immediate interest in eating him."}
{"text_id":"88-b1","simplified":"When the boy is 16, a new government is chosen that his parents don't support. Worried about the future, the boy's parents decide to close the zoo and move to Canada. Some of the animals are sold to zoos in North America and the family travel by ship to Canada taking the animals with them. On the way, there is a terrible storm and the ship sinks. Tragically, the boy's family and the ship's sailors all drown, but the boy finds himself in a rescue boat with a hyena, zebra, orang-utan and an enormous tiger."}

Since it was published in 2008 it has been translated into 26 different languages and has sold millions of copies around the world. It is also the first book for young readers to sell more than a million electronic copies. The Hunger Games is now a major Hollywood film and is just as successful. It made 152.5 million dollars in its opening weekend in North America alone!"}
{"text_id":"90-b1","simplified":"Maybe dreams happen because our mind tries to organize the thoughts we have during the day. But in dreams, these thoughts appear with special meanings and symbols. When we are awake, our thoughts usually come as words in our head, like conversations we have with ourselves. But when we sleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active. At the same time, the part that controls our emotions becomes more active."}
{"text_id":"91-b1","simplified":"Having good relationships is a big part of being happy. In one study, most happy people were seen to have strong ties to friends and family. They made sure they spent time with them regularly. You also need at least one person who you discuss personal feelings with – called 'self-disclosure'. Just one person for a heart-to-heart is enough, together with a network of other relationships. It's not enough to have lots of friends just to do things with or chat to about music or football. That deeper connection is all-important. Some people need to learn how to listen well to others in order to develop stronger relationships."}
{"text_id":"92-b1","simplified":"Psychologist Carol Dweck believes in the Growth Mindset. She talked about how our brains can change and how we can develop skills and talents that we were not good at in the beginning. Many of us like to praise the final result and natural talents. For example, we say You really have an eye for details or You have a real talent for organizing events. However, research shows something different. When we focus on the process - how things are done - we can help people develop new skills better. This means we should praise effort, trying new things, and problem-solving strategies. This way, people can keep improving their talents and learning new skills."}
{"text_id":"93-b1","simplified":"The rover regularly checks the air around it. In 2014, it found methane in the air. Methane is a basic organic molecule and a key part of natural gas. Methane only lasts for a few hundred years. This means something on Mars must be making new methane. NASA says Mars sends out thousands of tons of methane at a time. The amount of methane goes up and down with the seasons each year. It is almost like the planet is breathing."}
{"text_id":"94-b1","simplified":"Early in her career, the psychologist Carol Dweck of Stanford University gave a group of ten-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them. One group reacted positively, said they loved challenge and understood that their abilities could be developed. She says they had a 'growth way of thinking' and are focused on what they can achieve in the future. But another group of children felt that their intelligence was being judged and they had failed. They had a 'set way of thinking' and were unable to imagine improving. Some of these children said they might act unfairly in the future. Others looked for someone who had done worse than them to increase their confidence."}
{"text_id":"95-b1","simplified":"Horror films love empty places. This could be a deserted hospital, a scary empty house or a ghost town. There's something about lonely, empty places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's also that they are so quiet, which can be very scary too. Of course, deserted places are also handy for horror film directors in that it's more realistic that you will have no phone coverage there either."}
{"text_id":"96-b1","simplified":"No matter what kind of house it is, the basement is a scary place in horror films. That's usually where something is hiding or where the bad crazy person has hidden their tools. Basements are always dark and often damp. You can only reach them by a narrow set of stairs. And basements are always frightening, even when there isn't anything down there."}
{"text_id":"97-b1","simplified":"Gary Collins, an off-duty policeman, was watching the London trouble on TV. He immediately recognised several people and cut his holiday short to help with naming people. He ended up spending six months going through the CCTV film and managed to point out 190 people, many from their eyes alone. His help was of very great importance in the investigation. Even with 200,000 hours of film, face-matching software managed to find just one person."}
{"text_id":"98-b1","simplified":"Personally, I think it's interesting to consider how we'll speed up our development as a group by improving our bodies. Imagine if you could put a computer inside our brain! Soon we'll be able to do just that and make better our number ability, sight and sound understanding and our memory, and this idea is only going to become more and more normal."}
{"text_id":"99-b1","simplified":"It was a fascinating talk and the speaker was really right about some points. Take parental influence, for example. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing homework when they see their parents posting on social media while cooking dinner or waiting at a red traffic light? She also made a good point about people who want to be in two or more places at the same time. So they switch back and forth between their real conversations and online conversations. I see this all the time with my teenage daughter and her friends. They make plans to meet and then sit together silently while each one has a different conversation online."}
{"text_id":"100-b1","simplified":"As for news stories that make us think the world is an increasingly violent place, there is reason for some hope too. Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but countries are mostly living together more calmly than in the past. However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, the numbers are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely to be a result of violent crime than political conflict, the global murder rate fell slightly, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}
{"text_id":"101-b1","simplified":"Wasfia has dedicated her life to supporting human rights and has seen numerous international aid programs in her home country to educate and train women and girls. But once too often they have been left with nothing when such programs have stopped running. Wasfia saw that Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself. So she brought together two of her passions, mountaineering and human rights, in order to try and change attitudes towards women in her country. She at first took up climbing while working on aid efforts in Tibet and Nepal. In a coastal, primarily flat country like Bangladesh, most people have never set eyes on a mountain. Her effort seems to be doing the trick as other men and women in her country are sitting up and taking notice along with the rest of the world."}
{"text_id":"102-b1","simplified":"Most people believe that developing countries are in a terrible situation: They suffer from extreme poverty, are ruled by dictators, and have little hope for real change. But surprisingly, this is far from the truth. The reality is, however, that a big change is happening. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their income and left poverty behind. Also, six million fewer children die from diseases each year, millions more girls go to school, and millions of people have access to clean water."}
{"text_id":"103-b1","simplified":"Many managers try to make feedback more positive by putting negative comments between two positive ones. However, when feedback becomes this kind of routine, employees may start to see positive feedback as just a way to make the negative parts seem better. This makes the positive feedback less valuable. Instead, positive feedback should not just be used to soften negative comments. It should be given in a way that strengthens and encourages good performance."}
{"text_id":"104-b1","simplified":"I'm a member of the group called Stop Killer Robots. Forget the movie image of a scary killer robot stepping on human heads, and think about what is happening now: military machines like flying robots, guns fixed in one place, and guard robots are already being used to kill with very little control from people. The next step will be 'murderbots' that act on their own, follow orders, and in the end decide by themselves who to kill. To me, it is clear this would be completely wrong and dangerous for all people. We need to be very careful about what we ask machines to do."}
{"text_id":"105-b1","simplified":"In general, more people are studying English than the other languages combined and English is spoken in the highest number of countries. However, Chinese has by far the greatest number of native speakers. There seems to be little connection between how many native speakers a language has and the number of people studying it. However, there is a stronger link between the number of learners and how many countries have speakers."}
{"text_id":"106-b1","simplified":"Your manager stops you and says she needs to have a word about your performance in the recent work. You worry about it all weekend, wondering what you might have done wrong. When you step into her office on Monday morning she begins by saying good things about the good work you've done on the recent work, and you wonder if this is the required praise that starts off the typical 'comments sandwich'. You know how the comments sandwich goes: say something nice, say what you really want to say, say something nice again."}
{"text_id":"107-b1","simplified":"Even though Born in the USA is a fast rock album that makes you want to tap your feet, its lyrics carry a deep emotional feeling. Behind the catchy rock melodies that power these classic songs, there are stories about the difficult parts of the American Dream. Many songs show the struggles of ordinary people who work hard. They feel bitter and angry when life doesn't give them wealth or fame. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town who remember their youth, when they had many opportunities. Another song, Downbound Train, tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's easy to imagine that the artist writes about real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a famous star. The album clearly shows The Boss's special and great talent."}
{"text_id":"108-b1","simplified":"Lewis wants to see the number of protected areas in the world's oceans increase from 3 percent to 10 percent. This would help fix the damage caused by human activities like too much fishing, pollution, and trash. On his trips, Lewis has seen this damage to the environment up close. He has swum over coral reefs that turned white because the water got too warm. He also saw empty underwater areas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea, which had no life and were covered in plastic. Pugh believes that nature can recover if we give it enough space, but time is running out. If we don't start taking care of our oceans, we might soon have a problem we can't fix."}
{"text_id":"109-b1","simplified":"Best-selling author Terrie Sharp knows how to tell a good story or two, having twice won the Olive Crime Writer Award. Born in the housing area in Glasgow, which had the highest crime rate, she learned to keep quiet and stay out of trouble. She also learned how to open car doors with a knife. Luckily, she only used her knowledge to write her novels. She's not so quiet these days, appearing on popular daily shows like Police Today and at writing talks throughout the UK."}
{"text_id":"110-b1","simplified":"Some people worry that things are getting worse every day. They might think progress is not possible. But in his book, Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at how humans have made progress. He finds good news. He says that we now live longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. Pinker says the real problem is that people are attacking important ideas like reason and science. These ideas come from the Enlightenment. When people who speak in public try to make others feel divided, hopeless, or not trusting, then important systems can be badly hurt. These important systems include democracy and countries working together."}
{"text_id":"111-b1","simplified":"In older horror films, when main characters were in great fear, it was difficult or impossible for them to call for help or call the police. Mobile phones have made that situation a bit less realistic now. What's the solution to maintain excitement? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror film, it's almost certain that at a key moment, just when you absolutely need to call for help, you will not have any coverage at all. Or your phone battery will die just as you are making the call. Or both."}
{"text_id":"112-b1","simplified":"In the 1950s, Central American commercial banana growers were facing the death of their most money-making product, the Gros Michel banana, called Big Mike. And now it's happening again to Big Mike's successor – the Cavendish. With its easily moved, thick-skinned and sweet-tasting fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant was the main plant on the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the main grower and seller to other countries in South America at the time, made its bananas in very large numbers in the most efficient way possible. It cloned shoots from the stems of plants instead of raising plants from seeds, and cultivated them in fields where plants were very close together."}
{"text_id":"113-b1","simplified":"Spider poison is present in most types and serves the purpose of stunning or killing the animals they catch rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the recorded spider types produce poison which can actually harm humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are rarely deadly. Australia's notorious Sydney funnel-web spider has not produced any fatalities since anti-poison was developed in 1981. However, take care not to stroke furry spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by shooting out a cloud of itchy hairs. These itchy hairs then stick into the skin or eyes of the attacker."}
{"text_id":"114-b1","simplified":"This horror film cliché was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning the girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she has become the strongest and most capable person in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end."}
{"text_id":"115-b1","simplified":"If we want to know where our ability for complex language comes from, we need to look at how our brains are different from those of other animals. This is about more than just brain size. It's important to understand what else our brains can do, and when and why they developed in this way. But we have very few physical clues about this. Things left behind by our ancestors don't tell us what kind of language they could speak. However, one thing we *can* see in the remains of early humans is how their mouth, throat, and tongue developed. Around 100,000 years ago, people developed the ability to make complex sounds. Before that time, scientists who study evolution can only guess if early humans used simpler sounds to communicate, or not."}
{"text_id":"116-b1","simplified":"It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models young people see doing science-connected jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, very smart creator, or brave astronaut as a man. Furthermore, there is an unfortunate belief that scientists are not cool, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and separate from the rest of the world. These are false fixed ideas shown by news and TV, but they may mean girls do not feel close to scientists, and see science as an unattractive career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}
{"text_id":"117-b1","simplified":"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in university buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly valued by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural improvement and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Furthermore, some students cannot easily get the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university. An additional environmental issue is that a large number of copies end up as trash on campus."}

Although this might not seem high at first glance, the industry standard is seven per cent. The principal objective of this report is to look into the causes of worker involvement within the firm. Based on those, it will offer suggestions to improve workers' experience at work and increase how long workers stay."}
{"text_id":"119-b1","simplified":"So much of what the speaker said rang true. I honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more alone we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But people under 20 are very different. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of being alone. They run the chance of not finding out how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they are practicing conversation through messages that can be changed and fixed. But they are not learning real conversation with someone face-to-face and in real time."}
{"text_id":"120-b1","simplified":"Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. If positive and negative feedback always seem to come together, the positive feedback might lose its value and be ignored. Make sure there are times when positive feedback is given just for being positive, and try not to offer any constructive criticism then."}
