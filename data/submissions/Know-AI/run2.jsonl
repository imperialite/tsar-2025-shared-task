In the wild, some of the rarest species have difficulty in finding mates and breeding, and they might also be threatened by poachers, loss of their habitat and predators. A good zoo will enable these species to live and breed in a secure environment. In addition, as numbers of some wild species drop, there is an increased danger of populations becoming too genetically similar. Breeding programmes provide a safeguard: zoo-bred animals can be released into the wild to increase genetic diversity.", "target_cefr": "A2", "simplified": "Today, zoos have an important job. They help animals, especially those that are in danger of disappearing, to have babies. In nature, it is sometimes hard for these rare animals to find partners and have babies. They also face dangers like hunters, losing their homes, and other animals that might eat them. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies. When there are fewer wild animals, there is a risk that they all become too much alike. Breeding programmes in zoos help with this problem. Animals born in zoos can go back to the wild to make wild animals more different from each other."}

Even though the music is catchy and fun, the words in the songs have a lot of feelings. They tell stories about the difficult side of the American dream. Many songs talk about the problems that normal hard-working people go through, and their disappointment when life doesn't give them money or fame. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town who remember the past when they were young and life seemed full of opportunities. Another song, Downbound Train, talks about a young man whose life becomes very difficult after he loses his job. It's easy to think that the artist is singing about real people he knew or what his life might have been like if he hadn't become famous. The album shows how special and talented the artist, known as 'The Boss', really is."}

One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.
