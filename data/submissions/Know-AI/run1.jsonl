They have special breeding programs for these animals. In the wild, it can be hard for some rare animals to find partners to have babies with. These animals are also in danger from hunters, losing their homes, and from other animals. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies. Also, when there are fewer wild animals, they can become too much like each other. Breeding programs help by raising zoo animals that can be sent back to the wild. This helps wild animals to be more different from each other."}
