So, these small dogs go around asking for food for their whole group. Some clever dogs have even learned how to use the city's metro system! Scientists are curious about how they know when to get off at the right stop. One idea is that they use their good sense of smell to recognize familiar places.

In the wild, some rare species have trouble finding partners and breeding because of poachers, habitat loss, and predators. A good zoo provides a safe space for these animals to live and breed. This is especially important when some wild populations are declining. As this happens, there's a risk that the remaining animals will become too similar genetically. Zoos help by breeding animals in a controlled environment. These zoo-bred animals can then be released back into the wild to increase genetic diversity.","target_cefr":"B1"}
