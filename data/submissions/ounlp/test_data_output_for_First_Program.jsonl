Common dreams, like flying, falling, losing your teeth, or being naked in public, usually mean similar things for many people. To understand what they mean for you, think about your daily life and your feelings."}
{"text_id": "22-a2", "simplified": "One interesting case of wild animals in a city is the wild dogs of Moscow. There are about 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets of Moscow. Some dogs were born wild, and some were pets that people left behind. Some dogs live alone, and others live in groups. In 2010, scientists studied these dogs and found that they have adapted well to city life. They have learned it is safer to cross the street with people, and some dogs seem to understand traffic lights."}

Wonder has sold many copies in the United States and has won several awards. Many schools use it to talk about bullying, friendship, and being different. A movie is being made, and many people, including me, are excited to see what RJ Palacio will write next."}

She knows they are not usual pets, and she has tried many times to tell people that rats are not dirty and can be great pets if you take care of them. She understands why some people don’t like them. Chloe didn’t like rats at first, but her friend Martin showed her his pet rats, and she saw how loving and smart they are. Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided to get two of them."}
{"text_id": "25-a2", "simplified": "Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some have been hurt or killed in car accidents, and others have died from electric shocks while playing with wires. Baboons are an endangered species. To help them and reduce problems between people and baboons, the city council has hired a team of Baboon Monitors. Their job is to chase baboons away from the city or catch them and release them in the countryside. This plan has worked a little, but it is hard to stop baboons from returning to the city because they find easy food there."}
{"text_id": "26-a2", "simplified": "I work for a big IT company, but their main office is in the United States. I do all my work online from home. This way, I don’t spend time traveling or talking with coworkers. I work on different projects, and this is good for me because I can take time off when my kids have school events or when I need to go to the dentist. The bad part is that I don’t have set work hours, so I often work late into the evening and sometimes miss dinner to finish my work."}
{"text_id": "27-a2", "simplified": "In the 1990s, graffiti was still popular, but street art became very popular around the world. Some artists wanted to share their ideas about important issues like war, unfairness, and discrimination. Other street artists focused on making beautiful art. In South America, many street artists worked in poor areas, making grey city walls colorful and lively."}
{"text_id": "28-a2", "simplified": "Every day, social media, magazines, and store windows show people many things to buy. People in Britain are buying more clothes and shoes than ever.

{"text_id": "29-a2", "simplified": "Sam squinted at the sun and saw a dust trail from a car going to the Big House. The horses kicked and swatted at flies, not caring that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter only came out here when he had to, and that was fine with Sam. The more he stayed away from his boss, the longer he would keep his job. Mr. Carter wiped sweat from his neck. The wet spots on his shirt looked like shapes on a map. His skin was already getting red in the June sun. He looked like a man who made money while others did the work."}
{"text_id": "30-a2", "simplified": "Many people in Berlin, Germany, said that shooting pigs is very cruel. There were strong arguments between hunters and people who love animals. Because of the protests, the city council chose to try a kinder way to deal with the pigs. Instead of shooting them, they built fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. We will see if this plan works, but it might be hard because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before."}
{"text_id": "31-a2", "simplified": "Suzanne was inspired to write the Hunger Games because she loves Greek myths. When she was a child, she liked the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens is controlled by Crete, but the people of Athens fight back. As a punishment, the king of Crete, Minos, makes the Athenians send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people are put in a maze and eaten by a monster called the Minotaur. But one boy, named Theseus, fights and kills the Minotaur. Suzanne thinks of Katniss Everdeen as a modern Theseus."}

All year, Buy Nothing groups help people exchange and fix things they already have."}
{"text_id": "34-a2", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? It depends on how you see it. In many countries, writing or painting on public or private property is seen as vandalism.

{"text_id": "35-a2", "simplified": "What does the art world think about graffiti and street art? More people are starting to see it as real art. There have been big shows of street art in galleries in Paris, London, and Los Angeles. In 2008, the American artist Elura Emerald organized a street art show in a New York gallery. She supported street artists, saying, \"Artists who paint on the street are just expressing themselves and not hurting anyone. They should be appreciated and celebrated.\""}
{"text_id": "36-a2", "simplified": "Most people have four to six dreams every night after they turn ten. This means they can have about 2,000 dreams each year. By the time a person is 80 years old, they might have had around 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95–99 percent of our dreams, we still remember a few thousand dreams in our lives. It is easy to think that a dream can happen by chance before something similar happens in real life, especially if the dream is about something we see often."}

This might sound like a movie story, like the 1998 film Armageddon, but it is a real plan from NASA called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER). They would shoot eight-ton rockets at the asteroid to try to change its path. If the asteroid is too close for this to work, the rockets would have nuclear bombs to blow it up."}

{"text_id": "44-a2", "simplified": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea was that dreams show things we do not know about ourselves. Freud thought that if we understand our dreams, we can learn about our hidden feelings and problems. The other idea was different. It said that dreams are just random thoughts in our brain while it sorts memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to understand these random images and feelings and make a story from them."}

There were too many things to distract me, like housework, tea, and my family needing my help. So, I started working in a café, but the Wi-Fi was not good, and I drank too much coffee. Finally, I decided to rent a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers. I liked getting dressed for work in the morning and being able to focus in an office."}

{"text_id": "49-a2", "simplified": "Some people believe that writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. Lucid dreams are when you know you are dreaming and can change what happens in the dream. This means you can turn a scary dream into a nice one or control the story of your dream like a movie director. Instead of just understanding your dreams, you can create them. But, you might still want to have some dreams that let your mind share what it is thinking!"}
{"text_id": "50-a2", "simplified": "Many people do not know they help the problem of disposable clothing when they give their old clothes to charities. But charity shops cannot sell all these clothes. 'Fast fashion' becomes old very quickly and is often too low quality to recycle; people do not want to buy it used. A lot of clothes are thrown away, and many that charities cannot sell are sent to other countries, which creates more problems for the economy and the environment."}

Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed the highest mountains in every continent, biked across Canada, and run a long race in the hot Sahara Desert. But her most amazing trip was skiing to the South Pole. On the first day, she fell into a glacier and needed help. Many people would have stopped there, but Meagan kept going. After forty days, she reached the South Pole, pulling a sled with her tent and food through very cold weather and ice storms."}

In this culture, leaders acted like coaches who encouraged people to think for themselves and welcomed questions."}
{"text_id": "56-a2", "simplified": "When Gabriela noticed the cultural differences with her team, she decided to talk to them about how they felt about her leadership. Her team was happy to share their thoughts. They said they were not used to being told what to do and liked having more freedom to be creative. When Gabriela told them exactly what to do, they felt she did not trust them to do their jobs well. They understood that Gabriela took it personally when they tried to suggest changes, and they explained that this was how they had always worked."}

Right now, British adults owe about £670 each to credit card companies. This is 66 percent of what they spend on clothes. Also, people are buying things they do not need and spending money they do not have. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothes every year, and most of it goes to landfills."}

They also face dangers from hunters, losing their homes, and other animals that hunt them. A good zoo helps these animals live and breed safely. As some wild animal numbers go down, they can become too similar genetically. Breeding programs help by allowing zoo-bred animals to be released into the wild, which increases genetic diversity."}

Trains can cause a bridge to fall because they hit it very hard. Boats can make a bridge fall because they are very heavy, even if they are moving slowly. The best way to stop bridges from falling is to plan ahead. New technology can find weak spots, safer work areas, and better designs can all help to prevent these bad accidents."}

{"text_id": "91-a2", "simplified": "Having good relationships is very important for happiness. In a study, most happy people had strong connections with friends and family and spent time with them often. You also need at least one person to share your feelings with. This is called 'self-disclosure'. Just one close friend is enough, along with other friends. It’s not enough to have many friends just to hang out or talk about music or football. A deeper connection is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen better to build stronger relationships."}

They thought about what they could achieve in the future. \n\nThe other group felt judged and thought they had failed. They had a 'fixed mindset' and could not see how to improve. Some of these children said they might cheat later, while others looked for someone who did worse than them to feel better about themselves."}

Empty places make us think about what life was like when people lived there. Why did they go away? These places are very quiet, which can be scary. Also, they are good for horror films because there is usually no phone signal there."}

How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing homework if they see their parents using social media while cooking or waiting at a red light? She also mentioned how people want to be in many places at once. They often switch between talking in real life and online. I see this a lot with my teenage daughter and her friends. They meet up but sit quietly, each talking to someone else online."}

From the end of World War II to 1990, there were 30 wars that killed over 100,000 people. Today, there are still civil wars, but most countries are living together more peacefully than before. However, terrorism has increased in the last few years, and since World War II, more civilians have died in wars than soldiers. Still, not all the news is bad for civilians. Even though violent crime is nine times more likely to cause death than political conflict, the global murder rate went down a little, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}

Many songs talk about the hard lives of regular people and their feelings of sadness and anger when they do not get rich or famous. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town remembering their youth when they felt strong and free. Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job. The artist seems to share real stories from people he knows and what his life could have been if he wasn't a star. This album shows the amazing talent of the artist, known as the Boss."}

Now, with mobile phones, this seems less real. So, how do they keep the suspense? They make sure there is no phone signal! If you are a hero in a horror movie, it is very likely that when you really need to call for help, you will have no signal. Or your phone battery will die right when you try to call. Or both will happen."}

Now, the same thing is happening to the Cavendish banana, which is the main type grown today. The Gros Michel banana was popular because it was sweet, had a thick skin, and was easy to transport. United Fruit, the biggest banana company in South America at that time, made a lot of bananas by cloning parts of the plants instead of using seeds. They grew them in crowded fields."}

{"text_id": "115-a2", "simplified": "To understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It is not just about brain size; we also need to think about what our brains can do and why they changed over time. There are not many physical clues to help us. The things left by our ancestors do not show us what kind of speech they could make. However, we can see changes in the mouth, throat, and tongue of early humans. About 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simpler sounds to communicate."}

Many young people do not see positive female role models in science jobs. Cartoons and stories often show scientists, inventors, and astronauts as men. There is also a wrong idea that scientists are strange, have bad social skills, or work alone. These stereotypes from the media can make girls feel that science is not for them. If girls saw more positive female role models in science, it would help them feel more confident and included in those subjects."}

{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified": "What the speaker said felt very true. I really believe that the more connected we are, the more alone we can feel. This is not a big problem for my generation because we lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and that it is OK to be alone. But for people under 20, it is different. They are always talking online and may never feel alone. They might not learn how to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they are learning to talk through messages that can be changed, instead of having real conversations with people face to face."}

Some have been hurt or killed in car accidents, and others have been electrocuted while playing with electric wires. Baboons are an endangered species, so to protect them and reduce problems between people and baboons, the city council has hired a team of Baboon Monitors. Their job is to chase baboons out of the city or catch them and release them in the countryside. This plan has worked somewhat, but it is difficult to stop baboons from returning to the city when they find easy food there."}

The more he stayed out of his boss's way, the longer he would keep his job. Mr. Carter wiped sweat from his neck. The wet spots on his shirt looked like shapes on a map. His skin was already getting red in the June sun. He had the tan of a man who made money while others did the work."}

As a punishment, King Minos of Crete makes the Athenians send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people are put into a maze and eaten by a monster called the Minotaur. But one of the boys, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a modern version of Theseus."}

This might sound like a movie story, like in the 1998 film Armageddon, but it is a real plan from NASA called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER). The plan involves launching eight-ton rockets at an asteroid to try to change its path. If the asteroid is too close for this to work, the rockets would have nuclear bombs to destroy it instead."}

Freud thought that if we understand our dreams, we can learn about our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. The other idea was different. It said that dreams are just random activity in the brain while it organizes memories and events from the day.

So, I started working at a café, but the Wi-Fi was not good, and I ended up drinking too much coffee. Finally, I decided to rent a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers.

Many artists also use the internet to communicate and share pictures of their work. The art world is starting to recognize street art as a real form of art. Even though we don't know what will happen next, we can be sure that street art is not going away!"}

Her mother tried to protect her by not talking about the war, but Suzanne still saw news reports and knew her dad was there. This was a very scary experience for her."}

For example, busy parents used to avoid selling their children's old things at local markets or car boot sales. Now, with online marketplaces, they can easily sell baby clothes that their children have outgrown and expensive baby gear they bought, helping them earn some cash."}

They go through strong storms and the hot sun of the Pacific, but they manage to survive. Sometimes, Pi feels comfort from his three religions, but other times he feels very lonely and sad. Finally, they see the Mexican coast in the distance, and everything changes. I won’t tell you the ending, so you need to read the book to find out what happens to Pi and Richard Parker when they see land."}

She wanted to enjoy the quiet time before her parents came home and the house became noisy with talking, the TV, or her dad listening to jazz while cooking dinner. She also liked this time because she could play with her pet rats."}
{"text_id": "71-b1", "simplified": "In 2010, NASA's planetary defense team found and recorded 90 percent of the asteroids near Earth that are 1 km wide. These are called 'near-Earth objects' or NEOs, and they are the size of mountains. They include anything within 50 million kilometers of Earth's orbit. NASA estimates there are about 50 more to find, but they say none of the 887 known NEOs are a serious threat to our planet."}

However, because of his appearance, it is even harder for him. Other kids do not want to sit with him, and he sees them staring or whispering about him. Luckily, he makes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he talks to at lunch. But the first day is not the only challenge. Auggie finds out that his classmates are afraid to touch him, thinking they might catch something. Throughout the school year, Auggie experiences many ups and downs, and then a surprising and difficult event at a school camp changes everything."}

Even if a bored and rebellious teenage boy wanted to escape, he couldn't do it on foot. Sam looked at the biggest horse, which was kicking the ground with its strong hooves. He wondered if the boy could ride. A good rider could find a lot of trouble out here, far from anyone. But someone who didn’t know anything about horses and wanted to run away from his father might get into even more trouble."}

Climbing high mountains in cold weather and strong storms is still very dangerous, but the best climbers are now looking for new challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria started to love mountain climbing when she was a teenager. After finishing school, she worked as a nurse but continued to climb in her free time."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified": "After climbing Everest, Gerlinde chose to climb all fourteen of the world's mountains that are 8,000 meters high. To make it more challenging, she climbs without using oxygen tanks. This is dangerous because low oxygen at the top of high mountains can harm the brain and body. Gerlinde also uses her fame as a climber to help a charity for poor children and orphans in Nepal."}

For example, we might have a thick wool coat that we thought was stylish, even though we live in a hot country. We might have a smartphone that we stopped using when we got a new one. We may have a car that we only drive on weekends, or a guest room in our house that has become a storage room."}

{"text_id": "80-b1", "simplified": "Dogs that live in groups have learned that humans often give food to smaller, cuter dogs. So, these smaller dogs are sent to ask for food for the whole group. Some dogs have even figured out how to use the metro system to move around their area! Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their strong sense of smell to recognize the scents of places they like. Another idea is that they can understand the names of stations from the announcements. Now, metro passengers are so used to seeing dogs on the trains that they often don’t notice them."}

He began at a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and reached the river's mouth in Brazil after two years and four months, walking 6,000 kilometers. The Amazon rainforest has dangerous animals like poisonous snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars, so Ed faced many dangers. Fortunately, he only got a few thousand bites from mosquitoes and ants."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In Britain, the average person spends over £1,000 on new clothes each year, which is about four percent of their income. This may not seem like a lot, but it shows two bigger problems for society and the environment. First, many people are using credit cards to pay for these clothes. Right now, British adults owe about £670 each to credit card companies. This is 66 percent of what they spend on clothes. Also, people are spending money they don’t have to buy things they don’t need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year, and most of it ends up in landfills."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified": "Ed's walk would not have been possible without technology. He used a radio to ask the people in the rainforest for food and to cross their land. Many of them came to meet him and helped him through the tough areas. While he walked, Ed wrote a blog about his daily experiences. He used the media's interest in his trip to speak out against the destruction of the rainforest and to raise money for environmental and children's charities in Brazil and Peru."}
{"text_id": "84-b1", "simplified": "Businesses have realized that they can make money from the sharing economy by using resources that are not fully used. A popular business model now is for companies to create online platforms that connect customers with people who offer specific products or services. For example, Airbnb helps people rent out their empty rooms and houses for extra income. Another example is Uber, which allows people to use their own cars as taxis to earn some extra money in their free time."}
{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "One important job of modern zoos is to help with breeding programs for endangered animals. In the wild, some rare animals have trouble finding mates and having babies. They also face dangers from poachers, losing their homes, and other animals that hunt them. A good zoo allows these animals to live and breed safely. As the number of some wild animals decreases, there is a risk that they become too similar genetically. Breeding programs help by allowing zoo-bred animals to be released into the wild, which increases genetic diversity."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified": "Both types of accidents are very rare, but boats and trains can cause a bridge to fall for different reasons. For trains, it's the speed of the impact that can make a bridge collapse. For boats, it's their heavy weight that can cause the collapse, even if they are moving slowly. The best way to prevent bridge failures is to plan ahead. New technologies that can find weak spots, safer work areas, and better designs can all help reduce these serious accidents."}

Then he remembers there are hungry sharks in the water and realizes he must climb back into the lifeboat. One by one, the animals in the lifeboat kill and eat each other, until only Pi and a tiger are left. Luckily for Pi, the tiger, whom he names Richard Parker, is seasick and does not want to eat him right away."}
{"text_id": "88-b1", "simplified": "When Pi is 16, a new government is elected that his parents do not like. They are worried about the future, so they decide to close the zoo and move to Canada. Some animals are sold to zoos in North America, and the family travels by ship to Canada with the animals. During the journey, a terrible storm happens, and the ship sinks. Sadly, Pi's family and the sailors drown, but Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a big tiger."}

The Hunger Games is now a big Hollywood movie and is just as successful, making 152.5 million dollars in its first weekend in North America!"}
{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified": "Dreams might happen because our mind is sorting out the thoughts we have during the day, but they show up in dreams with special meanings. When we are awake, we usually think in words, like talking to ourselves. However, when we sleep, the part of our brain that helps us use language is less active, while the part that deals with emotions is more active."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "Having good relationships is very important for happiness. In one study, most happy people had strong connections with friends and family and spent time with them often. You also need at least one person to share your personal feelings with, which is called 'self-disclosure'. Just one close friend for deep conversations is enough, along with other relationships. It’s not enough to have many friends just to hang out or talk about music or football. That deeper connection is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen better to build stronger relationships."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Psychologist Carol Dweck, who supports the idea of a 'growth mindset', talked about how our brains can change and how we can improve skills and talents that we may not have been good at before. Many people often praise the final results and natural talents, like saying, \"You have a great eye for details\" or \"You are really good at organizing events.\" However, research shows that if we focus on the process of doing things—like praising effort, trying new things, and solving problems—we can help people develop new skills and improve their talents."}
{"text_id": "93-b1", "simplified": "The rover checks the air around it from time to time, and in 2014 it discovered that the air had methane, which is a simple organic molecule and an important part of natural gas. Methane only lasts for a few hundred years, so something on Mars must be making more of it. NASA says that Mars releases thousands of tons of methane at once. The amount of methane goes up and down with the seasons, almost like the planet is breathing."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified": "Early in her career, psychologist Carol Dweck from Stanford University gave some ten-year-olds problems that were a bit too difficult for them. One group reacted well; they said they loved challenges and believed they could improve their skills. Dweck calls this a 'growth mindset' because they focus on what they can achieve in the future. However, another group of children felt their intelligence was being judged and thought they had failed. They had a 'fixed mindset' and could not see how they could get better. Some of these children said they might cheat later, while others looked for someone who did worse than them to feel better about themselves."}
{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified": "Horror films often take place in empty places. This could be an abandoned hospital, a creepy empty house, or a ghost town. There is something interesting about these lonely places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? The silence can also be very scary. Abandoned places are useful for horror film directors because it makes sense that there is no phone signal there."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified": "No matter what type of house it is, the basement is a scary place in horror movies. It's often where something is hiding or where the bad person keeps their tools. Basements are usually dark and wet. You can only get to them by a narrow staircase. They always feel creepy, even when there is nothing there."}
{"text_id": "97-b1", "simplified": "Gary Collins, a policeman on holiday, was watching the London riots on TV. He saw some people he knew and decided to cut his holiday short to help identify them. He spent six months looking at CCTV footage and identified 190 people, often just by their eyes. His help was very important for the investigation. Even though there were 200,000 hours of video, facial recognition software only identified one person."}
{"text_id": "98-b1", "simplified": "I find it interesting to think about how we can make our evolution faster by improving our bodies. Imagine if we could put a computer in our brain! Soon, we will be able to do this and improve our math skills, how we see and hear, and our memory. This idea will become more common in the future."}
{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "It was an interesting talk, and the speaker made some great points. For example, she talked about how parents influence their children. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing homework if they see their parents using social media while cooking or waiting at a red light? She also mentioned how people want to be in many places at once, so they switch between real-life and online conversations. I notice this a lot with my teenage daughter and her friends. They meet up but often sit in silence, each talking to someone else online."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "While news stories often make us think the world is getting more violent, there is also some good news. From the end of World War II to 1990, there were 30 wars that killed over 100,000 people. Today, there are still civil wars, but most countries are living together more peacefully than before. However, terrorism has increased in recent years, and since World War II, more civilians have died in wars than soldiers. On a positive note, even for civilians, the numbers are not all bad. Although violent crime is nine times more likely to cause deaths than political conflict, the global murder rate has slightly decreased, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}

However, when these projects end, the women are often left with nothing. Wasfia realized that Bangladesh needed to be stronger, so she combined her love for climbing and human rights to change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing while working on humanitarian projects in Tibet and Nepal, since most people in flat Bangladesh have never seen a mountain. Her campaign is working, as people in her country and around the world are starting to pay attention."}
{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "Many people think that developing countries are in a very bad situation, facing extreme poverty, ruled by dictators, and having little chance for change. However, this is not true. In fact, a big change is happening. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have raised their income and escaped poverty. Also, six million fewer children die each year from diseases, more girls are going to school, and many more people have clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "Many managers try to make their feedback more positive by placing negative comments between two positive ones. However, if this becomes a habit, employees may start to see positive comments as just a way to soften the negative ones, which makes them less meaningful. Positive feedback should not just be used to soften the negative; it should be given to support and encourage good work."}

Right now, military machines like drones and robots are already being used to kill with little human control. The next step could be robots that decide who to kill by themselves. I believe this would be very wrong and dangerous for people. We need to be very careful about what we let machines do."}
{"text_id": "105-b1", "simplified": "More people are learning English than all other languages together, and English is spoken in the most countries. However, Chinese has the most native speakers. There is not much connection between the number of native speakers of a language and the number of learners. But there is a stronger connection between the number of learners and how many countries have speakers of that language."}
{"text_id": "106-b1", "simplified": "Your manager stops you and says she wants to talk about your work on the recent project. You feel worried all weekend, thinking about what you might have done wrong. When you go into her office on Monday morning, she starts by complimenting you on the good work you did. You wonder if this is just the usual nice comment before the real feedback. You know how the feedback sandwich works: say something nice, give the real feedback, and then say something nice again."}
{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "Born in the USA is a fast and exciting rock album, but its lyrics are deep and emotional. The catchy rock songs tell stories about the difficult side of the American dream. Many songs talk about the struggles of everyday people and the anger they feel when life does not give them success or happiness. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town remembering their youth when they felt full of hope, while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man whose life falls apart after he loses his job. It’s easy to see that the artist is inspired by real people he knew and the life he could have had if he hadn’t become famous. This album shows the amazing talent of the Boss."}

He believes this can help fix the damage caused by human activities like overfishing, pollution, and littering. During his trips, Lewis has seen this environmental damage himself. He has swum over coral reefs that have lost their color because of warmer water and has seen lifeless areas in the shallow waters of the Red Sea filled with plastic. Pugh thinks that nature can heal if we give it a chance, but time is running out. If we don’t start taking care of our seas, we might face a big problem soon."}

Terrie grew up in a neighborhood in Glasgow with a lot of crime. There, she learned to stay quiet, avoid trouble, and even how to open car doors with a knife. Fortunately, she only used these skills for her writing. Now, she is not so quiet anymore and appears on popular daytime shows like Police Today and at writing conferences across the UK."}

When people focus on tribalism, hopelessness, and distrust, we risk harming important institutions like democracy and global cooperation."}
{"text_id": "111-b1", "simplified": "In older horror films, when the main characters were in trouble, it was hard or impossible for them to call for help or the police. Now, with mobile phones, this seems less believable. So, how do filmmakers keep the suspense? They use no phone coverage! If you are a hero in a horror movie, it’s very likely that at a crucial moment, when you really need to call for help, you won’t have any signal. Or your phone battery will die just as you try to make the call. Or both will happen."}
{"text_id": "112-b1", "simplified": "In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America were losing their most profitable product, the Gros Michel banana, also called Big Mike. Now, the same thing is happening to its replacement, the Cavendish banana. The Gros Michel banana was popular because it was easy to transport, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet. United Fruit, the main banana grower and exporter in South America at that time, produced bananas in a very efficient way. They cloned shoots from the plants instead of growing them from seeds and planted them closely together in fields."}

Only 25 spider species can harm people, and while their bites can hurt, they are usually not deadly. For example, the Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia has not caused any deaths since the anti-venom was created in 1981. However, be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel threatened, they can release irritating hairs that can get stuck in the skin or eyes of anyone who bothers them."}
{"text_id": "114-b1", "simplified": "This horror film idea was very popular in the late 20th century. It begins with a group of teenagers having fun, and it ends with everyone dead except for one girl. At first, the girl is usually innocent, shy, and not very strong. By the end, she becomes the strongest and smartest person. The last girl almost always wins in the end."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "To understand where our ability to use complex language comes from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It's not just about brain size; we also need to consider what other functions our brains have and how they developed over time. There are not many physical clues to help us; the tools left by our ancestors do not show us what kind of speech they could make. However, we can see changes in the mouth, throat, and tongue of early humans. About 100,000 years ago, humans could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simpler sounds to communicate."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "Society, not nature, tells us that girls should like arts and humanities, while boys should focus on maths and physics. There are also not enough positive female role models in science jobs for young people to see. Cartoons and stories often show scientists, inventors, or astronauts as men. Many people wrongly think that scientists are nerdy, have bad social skills, or work alone and away from others. These stereotypes from the media can make girls feel like they do not belong in science and see it as an unattractive career. If girls saw more positive female role models in science, it would help them feel more confident and included in these subjects."}

A survey shows that university students and staff really appreciate the newspaper for entertainment, culture, and work experience. Printing the newspapers costs a lot of money. Also, some students find it hard to get a copy because they have to go to the university to pick one up. Another problem is that many copies end up as litter on campus."}

{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified": "What the speaker said felt very true to me. I really believe that the more connected we are, the more alone we can feel. This is not a big problem for my generation, as we have lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and understand that it’s okay to be alone. But for those under 20, it’s different. They are so busy talking online that they don’t know what it feels like to be alone and might not learn to enjoy their own company. Also, they are learning to talk through messages that can be changed, instead of learning how to have real conversations with people face to face."}
