Happy people make sure to spend time with friends and family regularly.\n\nYou also need at least one person to share your personal feelings with. Just one person for deep conversations is enough, along with a network of other relationships. It's not enough to have many friends only to do things with or to talk about things like music or football. That deeper connection is all-important.\n\nSome people need to learn how to listen effectively to others. This skill helps them build stronger relationships.","target_cefr":"B1"}
{"text_id":"92-b1","simplified":"Carol Dweck is a psychologist who believes in something called 'growth mindset'. She says that our brains can change and develop. This means we can learn new skills and talents, even if we weren't good at them at first.\n\nMany people tend to praise what seem like natural talents and final results. For example, we might say \"You're really good at noticing small things\" or \"You have a real talent for organising events\". We focus on what seems to be an ability that someone was born with.\n\nHowever, research suggests something important. Instead of praising the final result, we can encourage development by praising the process. We can praise people's effort, their experiments with new methods, and their problem-solving. When we do this, we encourage people to develop new skills and continue improving their talents.\n\nThis approach helps people keep learning and growing.","target_cefr":"B1"}

There is something about lonely, empty places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it is also that they are so quiet, which can be scary. Of course, these abandoned places are also useful for horror film directors because it seems more realistic when there is no phone signal there.","target_cefr":"B1"}

These people work hard but don't get riches or glory. They feel angry because life hasn't given them what they hoped for.\n\nFor example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town who remember when they were young. Back then, they felt they could do anything with their lives. Another song, Downbound Train, tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job.\n\nWhen you listen to these songs, you can imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew.

United Fruit was the main company that grew and exported bananas in South America at that time. The company mass-produced its bananas in the most efficient way possible.

The purpose of this venom is for catching prey, not for attacking people. Only 25 of the known spider species have venom that can hurt humans. Spider bites can be painful, but they rarely cause death.\n\nFor example, the Sydney funnel-web spider from Australia is very dangerous. However, since antivenom was developed in 1981, nobody has died from its bite.\n\nYou should still be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. When these spiders feel in danger, they protect themselves. They release a cloud of tiny hairs from their bodies. These irritating hairs can embed themselves in the skin or eyes of attackers. So it's best not to disturb these spiders or rub them the wrong way.","target_cefr":"B1"}

The tools and objects that people from long ago left behind don't show us what speech they were capable of making.\n\nHowever, we can learn something from the remains of early humans.

Before that time, scientists who study evolution can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds.","target_cefr":"B1"}

These are false stereotypes shown by the media, but they might make girls not identify with scientists.
