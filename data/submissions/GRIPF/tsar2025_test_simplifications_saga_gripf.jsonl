Also, there is a wrong idea that scientists are into books, not good with people, or that their work is alone and away from others. These are wrong ideas shown on TV, but they may mean that girls do not feel like scientists, and see science as not a nice job.

During his trips, Lewis has seen this harm to nature by himself. He's swum over coral reefs damaged by hotter water and saw empty areas under the water under the shallow water of the Red Sea, with no life and full of plastic. He thinks nature can get better if we let it, but time is short. If we don't start looking after our seas, we may soon have a problem we can't fix on our hands."}

Born in an area with lots of crime in Glasgow, she learned to be quiet, stay out of trouble, and open car doors in a tricky way. Luckily, she only used her knowledge to write her novels and she's not so quiet these days, talking on TV shows and at writing meetings in the UK."}
{"text_id":"110-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"Are things getting worse every day? Is improving an impossible goal? In a book by Steven Pinker, he looks at the basic thought of human improving and finds good news. We are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker argues, is that the important ideas of reason and science are being attacked. When speakers and leaders try to make use of people's group thinking, giving up, and not trusting, then we are in danger of causing damage that can't be repaired to important ways like voting and working together between countries."}
{"text_id":"111-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"In older horror films, when the characters were in problems, it was difficult or impossible for them to call for help or call the police. Mobile phones have made that situation a bit less believable now. What's the solution to maintain suspense? No phone coverage! If you're a hero in a horror film, it's almost certain that at a key moment, just when you really need to call for help, you will not have any coverage at all. Or your phone battery will die just as you are making the call. Or both."}

And now it's happening again to Big Mike's new type \u2013 the Cavendish. With its easy to move, thick peel and sweet fruit, the Gros Michel banana plant was common on the plantations of Central America. United Fruit, the big grower and seller in South America at the time, made many bananas in the easiest way possible: it copied the stems from the parts of plants instead of growing plants from seeds, and grew them in fields close together."}
{"text_id":"113-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"Spider venom is found in most types and is used for making the animals they eat stop moving or killing them rather than attacking humans. In fact, only 25 of the known spider types make venom which can really hurt humans, and although spider bites can be painful, they are not often very bad. Australia's well-known Sydney funnel-web spider has not caused any deaths since medicine for spider bites was made in 1981. However, be careful not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way. When they feel threatened, they keep themselves safe by throwing tiny bothersome hairs. These hairs then stick in the skin or eyes of the enemy."}
{"text_id":"114-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"This horror film familiar idea was especially popular with horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all enjoying themselves, and it ends with everyone dead except one girl. At the beginning, the girl is usually innocent, shy, and not very strong. By the end, she has become the strongest and best at solving problems in the world. The last girl almost always wins in the end."}
{"text_id":"115-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"If we want to know where our skill for difficult language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This is about more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they grew that way. And for this there are very few real hints; objects left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were able to make. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had grown the skill to create difficult sounds. Before that, scientists who study evolution can only guess whether or not early humans talked with more basic sounds."}
{"text_id":"116-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"It is people, not nature, that tell us girls should like arts, history, and languages and leave maths and physics to the boys. Also, there are not enough good female people children see doing science jobs. Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, very smart inventor, or brave astronaut as a man. Also, there is a wrong idea that scientists are unusual, have poor social skills, or that their work is alone and away from the rest of the world. These are false ideas shown by TV and movies, but they may mean that girls do not feel like they are with scientists, and see science as a not interesting job choice. If girls saw more good female people in science it would give them more believe in themselves and a better feel included in those subjects."}
{"text_id":"117-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with an audience of about 10,000 students. It is written and produced entirely by students. The survey shows that the newspaper is highly appreciated by university students and staff for entertainment, cultural improvement, and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is large. Also, some students do not have an easy way to get the paper, since the only way to get a copy is to physically go to university. Another environmental problem is that a large number of copies become trash on campus."}

Although this might not seem high at first, the industry standard is seven per cent. The main goal of this report is to find out why employees stay interested within the firm and, from this, make suggestions to improve how employees feel at work and help employees stay."}
{"text_id":"119-b1","target_cefr":"B1","simplified":"So much of what the speaker said felt right. I honestly believe there is a risk that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. But the under 20s are completely different. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and might not learn how to enjoy their own company. In addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed instead of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."}

When positive and negative feedback are always together, the positives can become not valued and ignored. Ensure there are times when positive feedback is given alone and try not to give helpful feedback."}
