Maybe it's also the quiet ones that are so quiet, it can be very scary too. Obviously abandoned places are for horror filmmakers it's more likely that there will be no phone coverage."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified": "No matter the kind of house it is, the basement is a scary place in horror movies. That's usually where something is hiding or where the bad guy hides his tools. Basements are dark always and are often wet. You can only get to them by a narrow staircase. The cellars are always creepy when there's nothing in the basement."}

He ended up spending six months examining the CCTV footage and was able to identify 190 people. His help was of crucial importance in the investigation. Even 200,000 hours of footage, face recognition software managed to identify one person."}

How can we expect teens to not write emails while they're doing their homework? They can't see their parents texting or texting or texting. She also said a point about people wanting to be in two places at once. They switch on and off between real life conversations and on-line conversations. I see it all the time with her teenage daughter and her friends. They schedule to meet up and sit in silence while they talk to each other."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "For news stories that make us think the world is violent there is also reason to be optimistic. Between the end of World War II and 1990 there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are civil wars mostly countries coexist more peacefully than in the past. However, terrorism in recent years has killed more people than it has killed in the past. Although for civilians also the statistics are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely than violent crimes, the number of deaths per 100,000 people in the U.S. has decreased in recent years."}

{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "The majority of people believe in developing countries are in terrible condition, suffering from dictatorship and have little hope for change. However, surprisingly, this is far from being true. The reality is that a great transformation is happening. Over the past 20 years, over 700 million people have increased their incomes and gotten out of poverty. Additionally six million children die less every year from diseases, more girls are in school and millions get access to clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "In trying to give some positivity to the feedback they put a lot of positive feedback. When feedback becomes such, they can take advantage of positive feedback to reduce negative feedback. The positive feedback should not be seen as merely affecting but should be shown to boost good performance."}
{"text_id": "104-b1", "simplified": "I am a member of the Campaign to Stop Robbery Robbers. Forget the filming of a deadly Terminator and think about the machines that are used to kill people. The next step will be autonomous \"robots\" who decide on their own to kill. It seems to me clear that this is completely unethical and would be harmful to humanity. We need to be very careful of what we ask machines to do."}

{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "A fast-paced rock album, Born's lyrics have an emotional feel. Behind the catchy rock melodies are the powerful classics of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the hard-working people's pain and pain as they feel pain and pain. The song Glory Days is about a young man in the world looking back at his life as a young man. He is not difficult to imagine the artist is communicating with real people he knew and the life he could have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you no doubt about the unique talent of the Boss."}

We are living longer, healthier, longer lives and freer and happier. The real problem Pinker claims is that the Enlightenment values are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's wishes and wishes to change their minds, they do so in the name of peace and justice."}
{"text_id": "111-b1", "simplified": "In older horror movies the protagonists were in desperate need of help or call the police. Mobile phones have made that situation a little less believable. What's solution to sustain the suspense. Nophone coverage with phone coverage. If you are a hero in a horror film it is almost certain that in an emergency call you will not be able to answer the phone. Or battery of your phone will die while the call is being made. Not two or three but both."}

The Australia's notorious Sydney spider has not produced any since antibody was developed in 1981. You must be careful not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas over dirt. When they feel danger they launch themselves into the water. The irritating hairs then get embedded in the skin or skin of the person."}
{"text_id": "114-b1", "simplified": "This cliche of horror film was popular with horror films in the late 20th century. It starts with a group of teenagers all having fun and ends with people dying except for one girl. The girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she's become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins at the end."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "If we want to know the origin of our complex language we have to look at how different our brains are from other animals. This is related to more than just brain size. It is important what other brains do. For this there are very few clues that artifacts leave us with. Our ancestors did not speak. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans is the development of mouth and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had developed the ability to make complex sounds. Before this, evolutionary biologists can only guess that early humans communicated using basic sounds."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "The society is saying, not nature, that women should be given arts and leave maths to men. The same is missing positive women's role models who see jobs in science. Cartoons and scientists often show the mad scientist and adventurer as a man. Also, there is unfortunate sense that scientists are geeky, that they have no experience and that they are alone in the world. These are false stereotypes that are represented by women do not think of science as a career. Women would see more positive figures in science would give them more confidence in the subjects."}

Some students do not have easy access to the paper because they can get a copy of the paper. An additional environmental issue is that large numbers of copies end up as garbage on campus."}

{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified": "Much of the speaker's said sounded like the truth. I honestly think that there is a danger that as we are more connected we feel more isolated. I think this isn't a problem for our generation that's lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and we know it's okay to be alone. The under-20s are another set of catches. They're so busy with communication they don't experience the feeling of being alone. In addition they learn conversation by using messages that can be edited with the knowledge of talking in real time."}

When positive feedback is always going to go hand-in-hand with positive feedback, it can be seen that positive feedback is always going to go hand-in-hand with negative feedback.
