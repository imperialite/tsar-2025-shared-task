He ended up spending six months examining the CCTV footage to identify 190 people. His help was of crucial importance in the investigation. Even 200,000 hours of footage has managed face recognition software to identify one person."}

{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "The lecture was a fascinating speech and the speaker hit it off with a few words. Take parent influence, for example, the parents. How can we expect teens to not write essays while they're doing homework they see pictures on social media while they're cooking dinner? She also said a point about people wanting to be in two places at once. They switch up and down between real life conversation and online conversation. I see it all the time with her teenage daughter and her friends. They arrange to meet and sit together in silence while they each talk in a different way."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "As for news stories that make us think the world is more violent there is also reason to be optimistic. Between the end of World War II and 1990 there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are civil wars still but countries are more peaceful than in the past. However, terrorism has increased in recent years. In recent years, terrorism has increased in recent years. Although for civilians also the statistics are not all bad. Although deaths are more likely to be from violent crime than the deaths in the United States, the death rate is higher in the United States than in the United States."}

{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "The majority of people believe in developing countries are in terrible condition, suffering from dictatorship and having little hope for change. However, surprisingly, this is far from true. The reality is that a great transformation is occurring. Over the last 20 years, over 700 million people have increased their incomes and have been able to get out of poverty. In addition six million children die less every year from diseases, more girls are in school and more children have access to clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "In trying to give some positivity to their feedback they put a lot of positive feedback. When feedback becomes a routine, they can begin to perceive positive feedback as a way to diminish negative feedback. The positive feedback should not be seen as merely offsetting the negative, but should be reflected in the positive."}

The next step will be autonomous \"robots\" who decide to kill themselves. It seems to me clear that this is completely unethical and would be harmful to humanity. We need to be very careful of what we ask machines to do."}

{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "A fast-paced rock album, Born's lyrics have American weight. Underlying the rock melodies that power the classic are stories of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard working people and the anger they feel as life brings them no glory. The song Glory Days is about a young man in the world looking back at his life as a young man. He is difficult to imagine the artist is channeling real people that he knew and the life he would have if he were not a star. The album will leave you no doubt about the unique talent of the Boss."}

If we don't start caring for the oceans we may soon have an unsolved problem."}

We are living longer, healthier, more free, and happier lives. The real problem, Pinker claims, is that the Enlightenment values are under attack. When commentators and demagogues appeal to people's wishes, they do so in a way that threatens people's lives."}
{"text_id": "111-b1", "simplified": "In older horror films, when protagonists were in distress it was difficult or impossible for them to call the police. Mobile phones have made that situation a little less believable. What's solution to sustain the suspense. No phone coverage the phone coverage. If you are a hero in a horror film it is almost certain that in an emergency call you will not be able to get any coverage. Or battery of your phone will die while the phone is making the call. Not two or three but both."}

It starts with a group of teenagers all having fun and ends with everyone dying except for one girl. The girl is usually innocent, shy and not particularly strong. By the end, she's become the toughest and most resourceful person in the world. The last girl almost always wins the last girl."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "We want to know where our ability for complex language came from we have to look at how different our brains are from other animals. This is related to more than brain size. What really matters are our brains and how they evolve. There are very few clues that artifacts have left us. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans is the development of mouth and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago humans had developed the ability to make complex sounds. Before this, evolutionary biologists can only guess that early humans communicated using basic sounds."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "The society is, nature that tells girls should give arts and maths to boys. This is coupled with poor women's role models who see jobs in science. Cartoons and scientists often show the mad scientist and adventurer as a man. Also, there is unfortunate sense that scientists are geeky, that they have no experience and that they are alone in the world. These are false stereotypes that are represented by women do not think of themselves as scientists. Women would see more positive models in science would give them more sense of belonging in the subject."}

The survey shows that the newspaper is valued by university students and entertainment, for cultural provision and work experience. The cost of printing newspapers is significant. Some students do not have easy access to the paper because they can get a copy only if they go to university. An additional environmental issue is that large numbers of copies end up as garbage at the campus."}

{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified": "Much of the speaker's said sounded like the truth. I honestly believe that there is a danger that as we are more connected we feel more isolated. I think this isn't a problem for our generation that's lived without technology for a long time. We know how to be alone and it's better to be alone. The under 20's are another set of fish. They're so busy with communication they experience loneliness and don't know how to enjoy their own company. They also learn communication through messages that can be edited with the knowledge of real conversation with the person."}
