She knows people often react badly to them because she's tried to explain they're not dirty animals, but can make great pets if you look after them properly. Chloe changed her mind after seeing her friend's rats, which were affectionate and intelligent. Last year, she decided to have two rats after one of her friend's had babies."}
{"text_id": "25-b1", "simplified": "Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. They have been injured in car accidents and electrocuted while playing with cables. Baboons are endangered and the city council has hired a team of monitors to keep them away from the city. The monitors catch the baboons and release them in the countryside. This policy has helped, but it's hard to stop them from coming back."}
{"text_id": "26-b1", "simplified": "I work for a global IT company, but they are based in the US, so I do all my work from home. This means I don't have to waste time commuting or chatting with colleagues. I work on projects and this flexibility is great because I can take time off when I need to. However, without clear office hours, I often work late into the evening."}
{"text_id": "27-b1", "simplified": "In the 1990s, graffiti continued and street art spread around the world. Some artists created art that made a point about war, inequality and discrimination, while others created beautiful work. In South America, street artists added colour to poor areas, making them look more attractive."}
{"text_id": "28-b1", "simplified": "Many shops and magazines show people many things to buy. People in Britain buy more clothes and shoes than ever. Buying things online is very easy. But some brands make very cheap clothes that we don't think twice about throwing away after just a few uses."}

He had a nice tan from staying inside all day."}
{"text_id": "30-b1", "simplified": "Many city residents in Berlin complained about shooting pigs as it was unnecessarily cruel. Hunters and animal lovers had heated arguments over it. The city council decided to take a more peaceful approach instead. They put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. Whether this strategy works is yet to be seen, but warmer winters may lead to more pigs."}

Throughout the year, Buy Nothing groups exchange and repair items they already own."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? This depends on what you think. In many countries, writing or painting on buildings and other property is considered vandalism. Many street artists have been stopped by police and had to pay fines. City councils are unhappy about the cost of cleaning graffiti off buildings and other things."}
{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "The art world is becoming more accepting of street art. There have been exhibitions of street art in big cities like Paris, London and Los Angeles. In 2008, an American artist named Elura Emerald showed her work in New York. She said that street artists are just expressing themselves and not causing any harm. They should be appreciated."}
{"text_id": "36-b1", "simplified": "Most people have four to six dreams every night after they are ten years old. They have around 2,000 dreams per year. By the time they are 80, they might have had 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget most of our dreams, that's still a few thousand. It's not hard to believe that a dream event is followed by a real-life event that's similar."}

The Capitol has complete control over the nation. Each district provides different things for the Capitol. District 12, where the story starts, produces all the coal for the country. There used to be a thirteenth district, but they rebelled against the Capitol and were destroyed."}

The enemy is Darth Vader in the special world of the Death Star."}

{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, there were two main ideas about dreams. One was that dreams reveal our hidden feelings. The other theory was that dreams are just random brain activity. When we wake up, we try to make sense of our dreams and put them into a story."}
{"text_id": "45-b1", "simplified": "I work for myself as a freelancer. It's great because I am in control. At first, I worked from home, but it was hard to concentrate because there were many distractions. I decided to work in a café, but the Wi-Fi wasn't good and I drank too much coffee. I then moved to a co-working space where I could focus and like going to the office every day."}
{"text_id": "46-b1", "simplified": "Whether NASA can find the remaining asteroids depends on getting the money to build a space telescope that can locate them using infrared light.

{"text_id": "49-b1", "simplified": "Some people think that writing your dreams can help you have more control over your dreams. Lucid dreams are when you're aware that you're dreaming and can make things happen in your dream. By writing down your dreams, you can turn a bad dream into a good one or make your dreams feel safer. This way, you can create your own dreams instead of just trying to understand them. You might still want to have some dreams that help your subconscious tell you what's on your mind."}
{"text_id": "50-b1", "simplified": "Many people donate their old clothes to charities. However, charity shops can't sell all of them. 'Fast fashion' is not worth buying second-hand because it's of poor quality. As a result, unwanted clothes are thrown away, and charities send the rest abroad, causing more economic and environmental issues."}
{"text_id": "51-b1", "simplified": "Many adventurers go from challenge to challenge. One example is Meagan McGrath from Canada, who has climbed the highest mountain on each continent and run a race in the Sahara Desert in very hot weather. She also skied to the South Pole.

In Sweden, leaders were more like coaches, encouraging independent thought and expecting to be challenged."}
{"text_id": "56-b1", "simplified": "When Gabriela realized the cultural differences between her and her team, she decided to have an open conversation about their feelings about her leadership. Her team appreciated being asked for their thoughts and openly expressed that they didn't like being told what to do. They enjoyed having more room for initiative and creative freedom. They felt that Gabriela didn't trust them to do their job well when she told them exactly what to do. They realized that Gabriela was taking it personally when they tried to challenge or change her decisions, and explained that this was how they had always worked."}

{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In Britain, people spend over £1,000 on new clothes each year, which is about four percent of their income. This spending hides two problems for society and the environment. Firstly, most people pay for clothes on credit cards. Currently, British people owe around £670 to credit card companies. This is 66 percent of the average cost of new clothes. Secondly, people are buying things they don't need, using money they don't have. As a result, Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothes each year."}

For example, parental influence can make teenagers not want to focus on their homework when they see their parents doing the same things on social media.

I see this happen with my teenage daughter and her friends, who often sit in silence while chatting online."}

{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "Born in the USA is a rock album with emotional lyrics. The catchy melodies hide stories of the American dream's dark side. Many songs are about ordinary people struggling with life not giving them wealth or fame.

The artist probably wrote about real people and the life he might have had. The album shows Bruce Springsteen's unique talent."}

{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "To understand how humans developed complex language, we need to look at our brain's differences from other animals. Our brain's ability to process information and its evolution is crucial. Unfortunately, we can't find many physical clues to help us understand how our ancestors spoke. However, studying the remains of early humans shows us that their mouth, throat, and tongue developed over time, which allowed them to make complex sounds by 100,000 years ago."}

If they saw more female role models in science, they would feel more confident and happy doing science subjects."}
