Forget the movie image of machines like drones and gun turrets that are already used to kill people. Think of what's happening right now: these machines are being used to kill with very little human input. The next step will be machines that can decide who to kill on their own. It seems clear that this would be very bad for humanity. We need to be very careful about what we ask machines to do."}

You know how the feedback sandwich goes: say something nice, say what you really want to say, say something nice again. You'll be there until the trial. This is where the fun begins. It's not good for business."}

Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerful songs are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of ordinary people and the bitterness they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song Glory Days tells the story of people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet. The album will leave you no doubt about the unique talent of the artist."}

This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds."}

There is a perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills, or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. This perception may mean that girls don't identify with scientists and see science as an unappealing career path. If girls saw more positive female role models in science, it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}

But the under 20s are another kettle of fish. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company.

However, the other theory said that dreams are just a collection of random activity in the brain while it's organising memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these random images and feelings and put them into some sort of story. The first idea is that dreams represent hidden feelings and problems.

The metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals."}

He started from a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and arrived at the river's mouth in Brazil two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres. The Amazon rainforest is home to poisonous snakes, crocodiles and jaguars, so Ed was in constant danger. Luckily, he survived with nothing worse than a few thousand mosquito and ant bites."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": " In Britain, people spend more than £1,000 on new clothes a year, which is about four per cent of their income. That might not sound like much, but that figure hides two worrying trends for society and for the environment. First, a lot of that spending is via credit cards. British people currently owe around £670 per adult to credit card companies. That's 66 per cent of the average wardrobe budget. Also, people are using credit cards to buy things they don't need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing a year, most of which goes to landfill sites. "}

He used the media interest in his trip to protest about the destruction of the rainforest and raise money for children's charities in Brazil and Peru."}

A business model that has become popular sees companies providing an online platform that puts customers in contact with those who can provide a particular product or service.

Another example is Uber, which encourages people to use their own cars as taxis to make some extra cash in their free time."}

In this environment, the species can increase their genetic diversity and become healthier. In some cases, zoos help by releasing animals back into the wild. This increases the genetic diversity of the species and helps the population to survive. By doing this, zoos provide a safeguard for the species and help to protect them from extinction."}

With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down. With boats, it's the very large mass they have that can bring about the collapse, even if they are moving very slowly when it occurs. The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them. Modern technologies that can detect structural weakness, safer working environments and better designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents."}

One of the characteristics of methane is that it only survives a few hundred years. This means that something, somewhere on Mars, is replenishing the supply. According to NASA, Mars emits thousands of tons of methane at a time. The level of methane rises and falls at seasonal intervals in the year, almost as if the planet is breathing it."}

What was it like when people lived there? Why did they leave? Maybe it's also that they are so quiet, which can be very scary too. Of course, abandoned places are also handy for horror film directors in that it's more believable that you will have no phone coverage there either."}

She also made a valid point about people wanting to be in two or several places at once. So they switch back and forth between their real-life and online conversations.

Between the end of World War II and 1990, there were 30 wars that killed more than 100,000 people. Today there are still civil wars, but countries are mostly co-existing more peacefully than in the past. However, terrorism has shot up in the last few years and, since World War II, wars have killed many more civilians than soldiers. Even for civilians, though, the statistics are not all bad. Although deaths are nine times more likely to be a result of violent crime than political conflict, the global murder rate fell slightly, from 8 per 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}

{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": " The song \"Born in the U.S.A.\" carries emotional weight. Behind catchy rock melodies are stories of the dark side of the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hardworking ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory. The song \"Glory Days\" is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had the world at their feet. The song \"Downbound Train\" tells the story of a young man whose life is ruined when he loses his job. It's not hard to imagine that the artist is channelling real people he knew and the life he might have had if he hadn't become a star. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss."}

{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": " If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. And for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. One thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. Before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": " Girls, from a young age, are encouraged to favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys.  The lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs is also a concern.  Cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man.  Furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world.  These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path.  If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}

They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company.
