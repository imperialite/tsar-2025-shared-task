{"text_id": "33-a2", "simplified": "A different trend is springing up in opposition to consumerism – the 'buy nothing' trend. the idea originated in canada in the early 1990s and then moved to the us, where it became a rejection of the overspending and overconsumption of black friday and cyber monday during thanksgiving weekend. on buy nothing day people organise various types of protests and cut up their credit cards. throughout the year, buy nothing groups organise the exchange and repair of items they already own."}

{"text_id": "44-a2", "simplified": "Around the 18th and 19th centuries two main ideas about dreams became popular. one was the idea that the things we see in our dreams represent things hidden from our conscious mind. freud believed that if we understand what dreams are telling us, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they cause. however, the other theory was the opposite. it said that dreams are just a collection of random activity in the brain while it's organising memories and events from the day. when we wake up, we try to make sense of these random images and feelings and put them into some sort of story."}

{"text_id": "49-a2", "simplified": "Some people think writing your dreams down can open your mind to lucid dreaming. lucid dreams are dreams where you're not only aware you're dreaming but you can make decisions to affect the events of your dreams. so, maybe you can turn a nightmare into a safe-feeling dream, or you can direct the plot of your dream like a film director. then, instead of just working out the meaning of your dreams, you'll be creating them, though you might want to continue having some dreams that allow your subconscious to tell you what's on your mind!

{"text_id": "91-a2", "simplified": "Having good relationships is a big part of being happy. in one study, most happy people were found to have strong ties to friends and family and they made sure they spent time with them regularly. you also need at least one person who you discuss personal feelings with – called 'self-disclosure'. just one person for a heart-to-heart is enough, together with a network of other relationships. it's not enough to have lots of friends just to do things with or chat to about music or football. that deeper connection is all-important. some people need to learn how to listen effectively to others in order to develop stronger relationships."}

{"text_id": "103-a2", "simplified": "In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. however, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance."}

{"text_id": "115-a2", "simplified": "If we want to know where our capability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. this relates to more than just brain size; it is important what other things our brains can do and when and why they evolved that way. and for this there are very few physical clues; artefacts left by our ancestors don't tell us what speech they were capable of making. one thing we can see in the remains of early humans, however, is the development of the mouth, throat and tongue. by about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds. before that, evolutionary biologists can only guess whether or not early humans communicated using more basic sounds."}
{"text_id": "116-a2", "simplified": "It is society, not nature, that tells us girls should favour arts and humanities and leave maths and physics to the boys. coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs. cartoons and stories often show the crazy scientist, genius inventor, or adventurous astronaut as a man. furthermore, there is an unfortunate perception that scientists are geeky, have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and detached from the rest of the world. these are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path. if girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}

{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified": "So much of what the speaker said rang true. i honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. i don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. we know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's ok to be alone. but the under 20s are another kettle of fish. they're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. in addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."}

{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "In an attempt to inject some positivity into their feedback, many managers rely on sandwiching negative feedback between two positive comments. however, when feedback becomes such a routine, employees can start to perceive positive feedback as simply a form of sugarcoating the negatives, thus diminishing its value. instead, positive feedback should not simply be seen as something to cushion the negative, but should be delivered so as to reinforce and encourage good performance."}

{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified": "So much of what the speaker said rang true. i honestly believe there's a danger that the more connected we are, the more isolated we feel. i don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long. we know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's ok to be alone. but the under 20s are another kettle of fish. they're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company. in addition, they're learning conversation through messages that can be edited and changed at the expense of learning the art of real conversation in real time with the person in front of you."}
{"text_id": "120-b1", "simplified": "Don't always follow positive feedback with negative feedback. when positive and negative feedback always appear to go hand in hand, the positives can become devalued and ignored. ensure there are times when positive feedback is given for its own sake and resist the temptation to offer constructive criticism."}
