Common dreams like being able to fly or falling, your teeth falling out or having no clothes on in a public place probably mean something similar in most people.  But the key to understanding exactly what they mean to you is to connect them to the events and feelings in your daily life."}

Some dogs were born in the wild. Other dogs were once pets, but their owners left them. Some dogs live by themselves, and some live with other dogs. In 2010, scientists studied dogs. They found dogs live well in cities. They found it's safer to cross the road with others. Some dogs understand when to cross based on the traffic lights."}

Many people in the United States like to read \"Wonder.\" It is an award-winning book. This is a good way for schools to discuss important topics like bullying, friendship, and diversity. A film version is being made, and many, including me, are waiting eagerly to see what RJ Palacio writes next."}

She has lost track of how many times she\u2019s explained to people that rats are clean and good companions when properly cared for. But she understands why people react badly.  She didn't like rats either until her friend Martin showed her his pet rats and she saw how affectionate and intelligent they were.  Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided she'd like to have two of them."}

The city council hired a team to help the baboons and avoid conflicts with people. Baboons are sometimes found in cities. Monitors try to send them back to the countryside. This policy has had some success, though it is proving hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city once they see it as a source of easy food."}

{"text_id": "27-a2", "simplified": "Graffiti was still being made in the 1990s. However, street art became very popular in many countries. Artists used art to talk about politics. They wanted people to think about war and unfairness. These street artists wanted to make art that was beautiful and caught the eye. In South America, many street artists painted poor neighborhoods. They added color and beauty to the walls."}

The horses kicked and flicked their tails at flies, not caring about their owner's first visit in ten months.  Sam waited. Mr. Carter only came when he had to, and this suited Sam perfectly. The less his boss noticed him, the more secure his job was. Mr. Carter felt hot and wiped his neck. The wet areas on his shirt formed shapes, like those you see in a book of maps. His skin was becoming red from the June sun. He looked like someone who got rich without working hard himself."}
{"text_id": "30-a2", "simplified": "Many people in Berlin did not like that hunters were shooting pigs, because they thought it was cruel. There were strong disagreements between the hunters and those who love animals. In response to protests, the city council decided to take more peaceful action against pigs.  Instead of shooting them, they have put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs.  We need to wait and see if the strategy works. Warmer winters are leading to larger pig populations, which may make success harder."}
{"text_id": "31-a2", "simplified": "An important inspiration for the Hunger Games book comes from Suzanne's love of classical Greek mythology.  She loved hearing about Theseus and the Minotaur as a child. Crete controls Athens, but the Athenians disagree and rebel. Minos, the king of Crete, made Athens send young people as a punishment. Every year, they had to send seven boys and seven girls. The maze holds a dangerous monster, the Minotaur, which kills anyone who enters. A young man named Theseus killed the Minotaur. Suzanne sees Katniss  Everdeen is a future version of the hero Theseus."}

{"text_id": "33-a2", "simplified": "Some people are starting to reject buying many things. This is known as the 'buy nothing' movement. The idea originated in Canada in the early 1990s and then moved to the US, where it became a rejection of the overspending and overconsumption of Black Friday and Cyber Monday during Thanksgiving weekend.  People protest on Buy Nothing Day. Some cancel their credit cards as part of the protest. Throughout the year, Buy n Large was very innovative. They created a new technology to help with limited resources. However, this technology also gave the company too much power, and eventually led to people leaving Earth. No groups exist to help with trading or fixing used items."}

{"text_id": "35-a2", "simplified": "What is the art world\u2019s opinion on graffiti and street art? Recently, there has been a growing recognition of its value as an art form.  There have been major exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles.  Elura Emerald, an artist from America, organized a public art display at a gallery in New York City in 2008. She supported street artists. She said they are just expressing their ideas, and not causing harm. It is important to appreciate and celebrate them."}

They eat fruit from gardens and farms, and they also search trash for food. Some baboons are bold enough to enter houses and steal food from kitchens and refrigerators. Baboons can be aggressive towards pets. This is why many people who live in the city don\u2019t want baboons nearby."}

This idea sounds like something from a movie, like the film *Armageddon* from 1998. But NASA really proposed a plan called HAMMER. Big rockets, weighing eight tons, would be launched at the asteroid to try and change its path. The plan needed a safe distance from Earth. If the asteroid was too close, we would use bombs on rockets to explode it."}

The hero must pass tests and fight battles. They will also meet new friends before facing a major challenge. Luke\u2019s mentor is Obi-Wan. He is friends with Han Solo, R2D2, and C3PO. Darth Vader is his enemy, and the story happens on the Death Star."}

{"text_id": "44-a2", "simplified": "During the 18th and 19th centuries, two popular beliefs about dreams developed. One was the idea that the things we see in our dreams represent things hidden from our conscious mind.  Freud thought dreams give us clues about our feelings. These feelings can cause problems if we don't understand them. However, the other theory was the opposite.  Dreams are a result of the brain working to organize your daily experiences and memories. After we wake up, we try to find meaning in our dreams."}

{"text_id": "50-a2", "simplified": "People may not know they contribute to clothing waste, even when they give old clothes to charity. Charity shops cannot sell all clothes people don't want. Because fast fashion is a quick trend, it doesn\u2019t stay popular for long. It\u2019s also often too cheap to recycle, and people don\u2019t want to buy it used. Much waste is discarded, and unsold charity clothes are exported. This causes economic and environmental damage in other countries."}

Methane breaks down after a few hundred years. This means something is adding more of it on Mars. NASA says Mars releases a lot of methane gas sometimes. The amount of methane in the air changes throughout the year, like the planet is breathing."}
{"text_id": "94-a2", "simplified": "At the start of her work, the psychologist\u2026 Carol Dweck of Stanford University gave a group of ten-year-olds problems that were slightly too hard for them.  The first group liked the challenge. They also believed they could develop their skills. She says they believe effort leads to improvement, and they are planning for the future. Some kids thought people were checking how smart they are, and they felt they didn\u2019t do well enough. They had a 'fixed mindset' and were unable to imagine improving.  These children reacted in different ways. Some said they might cheat again, and others tried to feel better by finding someone else\u2019s bigger mistake."}

There's something about lonely, empty places.  Tell me about what it was like for people who lived there. Can you tell me why they departed? Sometimes, being very quiet can be scary, and that might be what's happening. Abandoned places are good for horror movies. People expect you can't get a phone signal there."}

Because of this, he ended his vacation early to assist with identifying others. He ended up spending six months going through the CCTV film and managed to identify 190 people, many from their eyes alone.  Without his help, the investigation would have been difficult.

If parents use their phones for social media while doing other things, like cooking or waiting, it's difficult to ask teens to focus on homework without texting. She also made a valid point about people wanting to be in two or several places at once.  They have conversations with people both online and when they meet face-to-face. I see it all the time with my teenage daughter and her friends.  They agreed to meet. While sitting together, they each talked to different people online."}
{"text_id": "100-a2", "simplified": "Although we hear a lot about violence, the situation isn't completely negative. From the end of World War II until 1990, wars were common. Thirty of them killed more than 100,000 people. Civil wars continue today, but countries are usually more peaceful now compared to the past. Recently, terrorism has become a bigger problem. Wars have killed mostly civilians since World War II. Even people who are not soldiers can find some good news in the statistics. Violent crime causes much more death than political conflict. Globally, the murder rate went down between 2000 and 2015, from 8 to 5.3 per 100,000 people."}

However, these projects often end without giving lasting support. Bangladesh needed improvement, Wasfia thought. She decided to use her passions for climbing and human rights to help women in her country. She learned to climb while working on aid projects in Tibet and Nepal. This is unusual because Bangladesh is a flat country and most people there have never seen mountains. More people are noticing her campaign, both at home and internationally, so it appears to be successful."}
{"text_id": "102-a2", "simplified": "Most people think developing countries have serious problems. They often have extreme poverty, leaders who have too much power, and little chance for improvement. This is actually not the case. There is a large change taking place. In the last 20 years, over 700 million people have become wealthier and are no longer poor. Fewer children are dying from disease \u2013 six million fewer each year. More girls are attending school, and more people have clean water available."}
{"text_id": "103-a2", "simplified": "Managers often balance negative feedback with positive comments to help people receive it better.

The next step will be autonomous 'murderbots', following orders but ultimately deciding who to kill on their own.  This is clearly a bad idea and could be dangerous. Be careful about what you ask machines to do."}

You thought about what you might have done incorrectly. First, she told you she liked your work. You wondered if she was preparing to give you negative feedback. It's common to use a \"feedback sandwich\" when giving advice. You start with praise, then give the criticism, and finish with more praise."}
{"text_id": "107-a2", "simplified": "Born in the USA is a lively rock album with a strong beat. However, the songs also have deep and serious meaning. Famous rock songs often tell stories about the difficulties of achieving the American dream. Many tracks deal with the struggles of hard-working ordinary people and the bitterness and anger they feel as life doesn't bring them riches or glory.  The song \"Glory\" is popular. \"Days\" focuses on people remembering their younger years in a small town. \"Downbound Train\" tells the story of a young man who faces hardship after losing his job. The artist likely used people from his past and imagined a different life for himself. This album will clearly show how talented the Boss is."}

Like before with Big Mike, the Cavendish banana is also affected. The Gros Michel banana was a very important crop in Central America. Its fruit was sweet, had a thick peel, and was easy to move around. United Fruit was a large company that grew and sold bananas in South America. To grow them quickly and cheaply, they used a special method. They copied parts of banana plants instead of using seeds, and planted them very close together."}

Only 25 types have venom that can cause harm. Spider bites are painful, but rarely cause death. The Sydney funnel-web spider is dangerous, but no one in Australia has died from its bite since 1981. This is because of an antidote. However, take care not to rub hairy spiders like tarantulas up the wrong way.  When they feel in danger, they defend themselves by ejecting a cloud of urticating hairs.  If someone attacks, these hairs can get into their skin or eyes and cause pain."}

Usually, the final girl is the winner."}
{"text_id": "115-a2", "simplified": "To understand how humans developed complex language, we need to study the human brain and compare it to the brains of other animals. What our brains can do is as important as their size. We also need to know why and when these abilities developed. We have very little evidence about how people spoke long ago. We can learn about early humans by studying their bones. One thing we see is changes in their mouths, throats, and tongues. People began to create complex sounds roughly 100,000 years ago. In the past, it was hard for scientists to know how early humans communicated, and they could only guess."}
{"text_id": "116-a2", "simplified": "It\u2019s society that decides which subjects girls and boys should study, not natural differences. A problem is the limited number of female scientists young people see. Often, cartoons and stories show men as scientists, inventors, or astronauts. People often have a negative idea about scientists. They think scientists are awkward and prefer to work by themselves. These are false stereotypes portrayed by the media, but they may mean that girls do not identify with scientists, and see science as an unappealing career path.  If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}
{"text_id": "117-a2", "simplified": "The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed free in faculty buildings, with a readership of approximately 10,000 students.  This is made by students, and they also write it. The survey found that students and staff at the university like the newspaper a lot. Newspapers have high printing costs. Furthermore, some students do not have easy access to the paper, since the only way to obtain a copy is to physically go to university.  Many copies are thrown away and become litter, which is bad for the environment."}

{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified": "The speaker said things that felt right. I think it's possible that being very connected can make people feel lonely. I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long.  We can be alone, and that is perfectly fine. People under 20 are a different case. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company.  They are practicing conversations by sending messages they can edit. However, this could make it harder to have real-time conversations with people nearby."}

This is good for me because I can take time off when my kids have school activities or when I need to see a doctor. The problem is that I often work late into the night when I don\u2019t have set work hours."}
{"text_id": "27-b1", "simplified": "In the 1990s, people continued to paint graffiti. Also, street art became very popular worldwide. Some artists made art with a political message. Their art asked people to think about war, unfair treatment, and prejudice. Other artists who worked in public spaces cared more about creating art that people would find pleasing. South American street artists improved poor areas by painting colorful art on city walls."}

Freud thought dreams are important because they reveal our hidden feelings and the reasons for our difficulties. There was a second idea, and it disagreed with the first. Dreams are simply random brain activity. This happens when your brain sorts out memories and events from the day. Dreams can be confusing, but when we wake up, we try to understand what they mean."}

With trains, it's the velocity of the impact that can bring a bridge down.  The size of boats can cause problems, even at slow speeds. The best way to avoid bridge failures is to plan for them.  Finding problems with structures, having safe workplaces, and good designs can all help prevent these accidents."}

There's something about lonely, empty places.  Tell me about what it was like for people who lived there. What reason did they have for leaving?

How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing their homework when they witness their parents posting on social media while cooking the evening meal or waiting at a red light?  She correctly pointed out that people often feel like they need to be in more than one place. They often change between real and online chats.

During the years between the end of World War II and 1990, thirty wars led to the deaths of over 100,000 people in each conflict. We still see wars inside some countries. But overall, countries are living together more peacefully now. There is more terrorism now than in the past. Since the end of World War II, wars have harmed civilians more than soldiers. The numbers are not completely negative, even for people who are not in the military. It is more dangerous to die from crime than from political conflict. The world saw a small decrease in murders between 2000 and 2015. The rate fell from 8 to 5.3 per 100,000 people."}

Behind the catchy rock melodies that drive these powerhouse classics are stories of the dark side of the American dream.  Songs frequently focus on the challenges of common people and their feelings of frustration when they don\u2019t achieve wealth or recognition. \"Glory\" is a well-known song. \"Days\" shows people in a small town remembering their youth, when they had many possibilities. \"Downbound Train\" is about a young man whose life gets worse after he loses his job. We can guess the artist created his work thinking about friends and family, and what his life would be like without fame. This album will clearly show how talented the Boss is."}

It's not only about how big brains are. It's also important to understand their functions and how they changed over time. Things people left behind don\u2019t tell us what they said. We can see how the mouths, throats, and tongues of early humans changed when we study their remains. About 100,000 years ago, humans developed the skill to make complex sounds. Previously, scientists studying evolution didn't know if early humans used simple sounds to communicate."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "Society, not nature, teaches girls to like subjects like art and history, and boys to like subjects like math and science. Coupled with this is the lack of positive female role models youngsters see doing science-related jobs.  Cartoons and stories frequently portray men in the roles of scientists, inventors, and astronauts. Many people think scientists are strange, not good at socializing, and work alone. The media often has wrong ideas about who scientists are. Because of this, girls may not see themselves as future scientists and may not want this job. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}

{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified": "What the speaker said made sense to me. Being connected doesn't always mean feeling close to others; sometimes it can lead to loneliness. For people like me, who didn't have much technology growing up, this isn't a big deal. Being alone is okay, and we know this well. People under 20 are a different case. They're so busy communicating that they never experience the feeling of solitude and run the risk of not learning how to enjoy their own company.  Also, they are learning to talk by writing messages. This can be changed easily, but it might stop them from learning how to talk face-to-face."}
