I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The problem is, when I don't have set work hours, I often work late."}

Our brains are special not just because of their size. Their abilities and how they came to be are also key. It is hard to know how our ancestors spoke because we have few clues. We see changes in their mouths, throats, and tongues. Long ago, around 100,000 years ago, people could create different sounds. In the past, evolutionary biologists could only guess at the sounds early humans made when they talked."}

It's also a problem that young people rarely see women in science jobs. We often see scientists, inventors, and astronauts as men in cartoons and stories. People often have the wrong idea that scientists are strange and lonely. The media often has wrong ideas about who scientists are. Because of this, girls may not want to be scientists. More women in science can inspire girls and make them feel like they belong."}

I don't think this is a big problem for people my age. We didn't grow up with technology. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone.  People younger than 20 are not the same. They talk to others all the time. They may not learn to be happy when they are alone.

That means that I don't waste time commuting or making idle chit-chat with colleagues.  I work on a project basis, and this flexibility is very valuable to me because it means that I can easily take some time off when my children need me to go to their school performances or if I need to schedule an appointment with the dentist. The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task."}

It kicked at the ground with strong hooves. Could the boy ride?  he wondered.  Far from other people, skilled riders faced many difficulties here. It was possible there were more difficulties for a person with no horse knowledge who also wanted to escape his father."}

Though climbing high mountains in freezing conditions and violent storms is still extremely dangerous, the world's best climbers now look for new challenges.  When she was a teenager, Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner developed a love for mountain climbing. She is from Austria. When she left school, she worked as a nurse, but kept climbing in her free time."}

{"text_id": "80-b1", "simplified": "Wild dogs live together in groups and have figured out how to get food from people. Amazingly, some dogs use the metro to travel within their territory. Dogs know when to get off the train, but the reason is still a question for scientists. They use their sense of smell to find places they enjoy, as they learn to recognize those smells. Another possibility is that they have learnt to recognise the names of stations they hear in announcements.  Either way, metro passengers have now got so used to the sight of dogs on the trains that they travel largely unnoticed by locals."}

He started by a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and arrived at the river's mouth in Brazil, two years and four months later, having walked 6,000 kilometres.  Ed was in constant danger because the Amazon rainforest has many dangerous animals. He survived the situation. He was bitten by mosquitoes and ants, but not badly."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "This cost represents around four percent of their earnings. The number seems low, but it actually indicates two serious problems for society and the environment. First, a lot of that consumer spending is via credit cards.  British people currently owe approximately \u00a3670 per adult to credit card companies.  Sixty-six percent of a typical clothing budget is this amount. Also, not only are people spending money they don't have, they're using it to buy things they don't need.  Most of these clothes are buried in garbage dumps."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified": "Ed's walk would have been impossible without technology.  He used a radio to communicate with the rainforest people. He asked them for food and to allow him to cross their land. People came to meet him and helped him navigate the difficult land. As he walked Ed wrote a blog, recording his day-to-day experiences.  During his trip, many news outlets reported on his activities. He used this attention to protest the loss of rainforests and to get donations for charities. These charities support environmental work and children in Brazil and Peru."}

{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "Strong connections with others are key to happiness. In one study, most happy people were found to have strong ties to friends and family and they made sure they spent time with them regularly.  Having someone to confide in is a good thing. Just one person for a heart-to-heart is enough, together with a network of other relationships.  True friendship is more than just sharing interests. That deeper connection is all-important.  Some people need to learn how to listen effectively to others in order to develop stronger relationships."}

The children felt they were being tested on their intelligence and were unhappy with their results. They believed their talents were fixed, not something they could grow. A few children considered cheating in the future. Others tried to feel better about themselves by looking at others\u2019 bad behavior."}
{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified": "Horror films often feature places where nobody lives. It could be a closed hospital, a spooky empty house, or a deserted town. I find empty places appealing.

Is it fair to tell teens not to text when their parents are using social media at mealtimes or in the car? She said something important about people's desire to be in multiple locations. So they switch back and forth between their real-life and online conversations.  I see it all the time with my teenage daughter and her friends.  They arrange to meet and then sit together in silence while each one engages in a different conversation online."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "Even though the world seems violent based on the news, there is some good news too. During the years after World War II and before 1990, thirty wars caused a very large number of deaths \u2013 over 100,000 in each war. Even with ongoing civil wars, countries are living more peacefully now than they did in the past. In recent years, there has been more terrorism. Wars since World War II have killed mostly civilians, not soldiers. The statistics aren't entirely discouraging, even for people outside the military. Even though violent crime causes more deaths than political conflict, murders decreased slightly worldwide."}

The popular melodies in these rock songs hide stories about the failures of the American dream. They express the disappointment and frustration of not achieving wealth or fame. The song is titled \"Glory\" and is well-received. \"Days\" focuses on people remembering their younger years in a small town. \"Downbound Train\" tells the story of a young man who faces hardship after losing work. He may have wondered about a life outside of fame while making his art. The album will leave you in no doubt of the unique and extraordinary talent of the Boss."}

Scientists who study evolution could only make educated guesses about how early people talked."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "We learn that girls should prefer art and literature, and boys should prefer maths and science \u2013 this is a result of social expectations, not natural differences. Young people don't have many women scientists to admire. Often, cartoons and stories present these roles \u2013 scientist, inventor, and astronaut \u2013 as being male. Scientists are often seen as being unusual and working in isolation. The media shows stereotypes about scientists that aren't real. This can make science seem less interesting to girls. If girls saw more positive female role models in science it would give them more confidence and a greater sense of belonging in those subjects."}

I don't think this is such an issue for my generation who've lived without technology for so long.  It's good to know how to spend time alone. It\u2019s also good to accept this. But the under 20s are another kettle of fish.  They are always connected with others. They don\u2019t experience being alone, and they might not learn to like it. They practice conversation with text messages that they can edit. This could mean they don\u2019t learn to talk well in person."}
