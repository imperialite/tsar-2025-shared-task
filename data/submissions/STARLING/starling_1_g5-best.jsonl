Methane breaks down after a few hundred years. This means something is adding more of it on Mars. Mars releases thousands of tons of methane gas, NASA reports. Each year, methane in the air increases and decreases depending on the time of year. It\u2019s similar to breathing."}
{"text_id": "94-a2", "simplified": "The psychologist did her first work\u2026 Carol Dweck, a professor at Stanford University, gave some math problems to a group of ten-year-old children. The first group liked the challenge. They also believed they could develop their skills. They think people can learn and grow, and they are focused on future success. Some children felt they were being tested on how smart they were, and they thought they did poorly. They believed their abilities couldn't be changed. Some children said they may cheat in the future. Other children tried to feel good about themselves by comparing their actions to those of others."}
{"text_id": "95-a2", "simplified": "Horror films are often set in places where no one lives. This place could be an empty hospital, a scary house, or a ghost town. I feel something in places where no one is around. Tell me about what it was like for people who lived there. Can you tell me why they departed? Maybe it's also that they are so quiet, which can be very scary too.  Horror filmmakers like abandoned locations. It feels more real if characters can't call for help."}
{"text_id": "96-a2", "simplified": "Basements are often scary in horror movies. This is often where things are hidden, or where a dangerous person hides weapons. Basements don't have much light and are usually damp. You can only reach them by a narrow staircase.  Basements are usually scary, even when they are empty."}

Teenagers see their parents using phones often \u2013 while cooking, or at traffic lights. So, how can we expect them not to text while doing homework? It's true what she said \u2013 people often want to do many things at the same time. They talk to people both in person and online. I notice this happening often with my teenage daughter and her friends. They met up and sat together, but each was having a separate conversation online."}
{"text_id": "100-a2", "simplified": "We often hear news about violence, but things aren't necessarily getting worse. After World War II ended and until 1990, many wars happened. These wars killed more than 100,000 people. There are still some civil wars happening today. However, most countries are more peaceful with each other than in the past. There is more terrorism now than in the past. Since the end of World War II, wars have harmed civilians more than soldiers. It's not all bad news in the statistics, even if you are not in the military. It is more dangerous to die from crime than from political conflict. The world saw a small decrease in murders between 2000 and 2015. The rate fell from 8 to 5.3 per 100,000 people."}

She wanted to change how people thought about women in Bangladesh. She first tried climbing during her work helping others in Tibet and Nepal. People in Bangladesh don\u2019t often see mountains because their country is mostly flat. Her campaign is getting attention. People in her country and other countries are beginning to notice her."}

It is difficult to see how things will get better. Actually, the reality is different. We are seeing a major shift in the world. More than 700 million people are now richer and out of poverty after 20 years. Also, six million fewer children die each year because of illness. More girls are going to school, and more people have clean water."}

Famous rock songs often tell stories about the difficulties of achieving the American dream. Regular people often struggle, and many songs express their sadness and anger about this. They feel disappointed when life doesn\u2019t give them success. This song, titled \"Glory,\" is famous. \"Days\" shows people in a small town remembering their youth, when they had many possibilities. \"Downbound Train\" is about a young man whose life gets worse after he loses his job. The artist probably used real people he knew in his art. He also thought about how his life could have been different. This album will clearly show how talented the Boss is."}

{"text_id": "110-a2", "simplified": "Is life becoming more difficult each day? Is it possible to make things better? The Enlightenment was an important time in the 1700s when people started using reason and logic. Steven Pinker studies how life has improved for people over time, and he believes things are getting better. We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives.  Pinker says the main problem is that people are questioning reason and science. When people are divided by group loyalty and feel they have no control, and when they don\u2019t trust each other, democracy and global cooperation suffer."}

{"text_id": "113-a2", "simplified": "Spiders have venom in their bodies. They use this venom to get food by stopping or killing small animals. It is rarely used on humans. Only 25 kinds of spiders have venom that can hurt people. Spider bites can be painful, but they are almost never fatal. Since 1981, no one has died from a Sydney funnel-web spider bite in Australia, because doctors can now use a medicine to stop the poison from hurting people. Tarantulas and other hairy spiders don't like to be touched the wrong way, so be careful. These animals protect themselves when they are scared by using irritating hairs. If someone attacks, these hairs can get into their skin or eyes and cause pain."}
{"text_id": "114-a2", "simplified": "This is a typical scary movie idea that was popular in the last part of the 20th century.

She finished as a very strong and capable person. The final girl almost always succeeds."}
{"text_id": "115-a2", "simplified": "Humans have complex language. To learn where this ability comes from, we need to look at our brains and how they differ from animal brains. Our brains are special not just because of their size. Their functions and development are also very important. It\u2019s difficult to know what sounds our ancestors made. We can learn about early humans by studying their bones. One thing we see is changes in their mouths, throats, and tongues. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had evolved the ability to create complex sounds.  In the past, it was hard for scientists to know how early humans communicated, and they could only guess."}
{"text_id": "116-a2", "simplified": "We learn from society, not from nature, that girls should study the arts and boys should study science. Also, young people don't see many women working in science jobs, so they have few role models. We often see scientists, inventors, and astronauts as men in cartoons and stories. People often have a negative idea about scientists. They think scientists are awkward and prefer to work by themselves. The media often has wrong ideas about who scientists are. Because of this, girls may not see themselves as future scientists and may not want this job. Girls need to see women working in science so they can feel confident and like they fit in."}

It is written and produced entirely by students.  University students and staff think the newspaper is very useful. They enjoy it for entertainment, learning, and work. Printing newspapers costs a lot of money. Also, some students cannot easily get the paper. They must go to the university in person to get a copy. Another problem for the environment is that many copies become trash on campus."}

{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified": "I agreed with a lot of what the speaker said. I think it's possible that being very connected can make people feel lonely. I don't think this is a big problem for people my age. We didn't grow up with technology. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone.  It\u2019s different with people younger than 20. They are always communicating with others, so they don\u2019t often feel lonely. Because of this, they may not learn to enjoy time alone. Also, they are learning to talk by writing messages. This can be changed easily, but it might stop them from learning how to talk face-to-face."}

The downside is that without clear office hours, I tend to work well into the evening, sometimes skipping dinner to finish a task."}
{"text_id": "27-b1", "simplified": "During the 1990s, graffiti remained common, and street art quickly grew in popularity globally. Some artists wanted to make political points and produced art that tried to make people think about war, inequality and discrimination.  Other artists who worked in public spaces cared more about creating art that people would find pleasing. Poor areas in South America became more colorful and lively thanks to street artists and their wall paintings."}

Mr. Carter avoided coming here unless it was important, and Sam liked that. If he avoided his boss, he would likely keep his job longer. Mr, Carter wiped the sweat from the back of his neck.

They chose to be gentler with the pigs. They stopped shooting the pigs. Now, they use fences to keep them contained. It is also against the law to give them food. We will see if this plan is successful. However, it might fail because warmer winters are causing more pigs to live."}

She loved hearing about Theseus and the Minotaur as a child. Crete controls Athens, but the Athenians disagree and rebel. Minos, the king of Crete, made Athens send young people as a punishment. Every year, they had to send seven boys and seven girls. The maze holds a dangerous monster, the Minotaur, which kills anyone who enters. But one of the youths, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it.  Suzanne sees Katniss  Everdeen is a future version of the hero Theseus."}

It grew in the US as a reaction to spending too much money on Black Friday and Cyber Monday. On Buy Nothing Day, people show their disagreement with shopping by protesting and canceling their credit cards. Buy n Large was a very creative company. They invented a way to compress things, hoping to save resources. This invention gave them a lot of power and eventually caused everyone to leave Earth. Nothing groups organise the exchange and repair of items they already own."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti a form of art, or is it damage to property? It depends on how you see it, but in many places, writing or painting on property is considered damage. Police have stopped street artists, and sometimes they must pay fines. It is expensive to remove graffiti from public places like buildings and transportation. City councils often complain about this cost."}
{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti and street art accepted by the art world? Recently, there has been a growing recognition of its value as an art form.  There have been major exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles.  The American artist Elura Emerald organised a street art exhibition at a New York gallery in 2008.  She believed street artists should be allowed to create their work. She explained that street art is a form of expression and doesn\u2019t cause damage. It is important to appreciate and celebrate them."}

They eat fruit from gardens and farms, and they also search trash for food. Some brave baboons have even come into people's houses and taken food from kitchen cupboards and fridges!  Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked a lot of pet animals, so understandably, many city residents don't welcome their presence."}

This idea sounds like something from a movie, like the film *Armageddon* from 1998. But NASA really proposed a plan called HAMMER. Big rockets, weighing eight tons, would be launched at the asteroid to try and change its path. If the asteroid came too close, we would use rockets with nuclear bombs to break it apart."}

{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified": "Two ideas about dreams became well-known in the 1700s and 1800s. Dreams could be a way for our unconscious minds to express themselves. Freud thought dreams are important because they reveal our hidden feelings and the reasons for our difficulties. However, the other theory was the opposite.  The brain creates dreams by randomly working with memories and events from the day. We try to understand our dreams by making a story from the images and feelings we remember when we wake up."}

So I started to go to a nearby caf\u00e9 to work, but the Wi-Fi connection wasn't ideal and I found myself drinking too much coffee.  In the end, I decided to rent a desk in a co-working space with five other freelancers like myself.  I liked preparing for work each morning and being able to focus while at the office."}

'Fast fashion' goes out of fashion as quickly as it came in and is often too poor quality to recycle; people don't want to buy it second-hand.  A lot of things are wasted and thrown away.

She correctly pointed out that people often feel like they need to be in more than one place. They have conversations with people both online and when they meet face-to-face.

There's a common belief that scientists are not very social and their jobs are isolating. Media stereotypes about scientists are not true.
