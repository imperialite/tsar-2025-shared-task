{"text_id": "21-a2", "simplified": "Dreams can show you new ideas about things you didn’t know you were thinking about. Some dreams are common, like flying or falling. Dreams where your teeth fall out or you have no clothes in public usually mean something similar for many people. To understand what your dreams mean to you, think about what happened in your life and how you felt."}
{"text_id": "22-a2", "simplified": "In Moscow, there are about 35,000 wild dogs living on the streets. Some were born wild, and some are pets that were left by their owners. Some dogs live alone and some live in groups. Scientists studied the dogs in 2010 and found that they have learned to live very well in the city. They know it is safer to cross the street with people and some dogs seem to understand traffic lights."}
{"text_id": "23-a2", "simplified": "Wonder is a book by RJ Palacio. She got the idea from seeing a girl with a different face on the street. The book is very popular and has won many awards in the United States. Many schools use it to talk about bullying and making friends. They also discuss what it’s like to be different. People are excited for the movie version. Many people, including me, wait to see what RJ Palacio will write next."}

She says rats can be great pets if you care for them. People sometimes react badly. Chloe did not like rats before. Her friend Martin has rats. Martin showed Chloe his rats. Chloe saw the rats are kind and smart. Last year, Martin’s rat had babies. Chloe decided she wants two new rats."}
{"text_id": "25-a2", "simplified": "Some baboons in Cape Town can be in danger. They can get hurt or die in car crashes, and some have been shocked by electric wires. Baboons are rare and the city wants to help them. The city has people called Baboon Monitors. Their job is to scare the baboons away from the city or catch them and put them back in the countryside. This has helped a little, but the baboons sometimes come back to the city because they find easy food there."}
{"text_id": "26-a2", "simplified": "I work for a global IT company. Their headquarters is in the United States, so I do all my work from home online. I don't have to go to an office, so I don't spend time traveling or chatting with colleagues.  I work on projects. This gives me flexibility. I can take time off to help my children with their school events or see the dentist. But without set working hours, I often work late into the evening. Sometimes I skip dinner to finish my work."}
{"text_id": "27-a2", "simplified": "In the 1990s, graffiti grew, and street art became popular worldwide. Some artists made pictures to show political ideas like war and unfairness. Others just wanted to make pretty art. In South America, many street artists painted colorful pictures in poor areas to make the cities look better."}
{"text_id": "28-a2", "simplified": "Social media, magazines and shop windows show many things to buy every day. British people buy more clothes and shoes than before.

{"text_id": "29-a2", "simplified": "Sam looked at the dusty road made by the car. The car was going to the Big House. The horses were kicking and moving their tails. They didn’t care about their owner coming for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter didn’t come here often, and that was good for Sam. If Sam didn’t do much, he would keep his job longer. Mr. Carter was sweating. It was wet on his shirt. The wet spots looked like shapes on a map. The sun was hot, and Sam’s skin was getting red. He had a tan from working and making money."}
{"text_id": "30-a2", "simplified": "Some people in Berlin say shooting pigs is cruel. They argue with hunters. The city council changed the plan. They will use fences instead of guns. They also stop giving pigs food. The city will see if this helps. It might be hard because winters are warmer. More pigs may appear."}
{"text_id": "31-a2", "simplified": "Suzanne liked Greek stories when she was a child. One of her favourite stories was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In the story, the city of Athens was ruled by Crete. The Athenians did not want to follow Crete. They were punished. Every year, the king of Crete, Minos, sent seven boys and seven girls from Athens to Crete. The children were put into a big maze called a labyrinth. In the maze lived a monster called the Minotaur. The monster ate the children. One boy, Theseus, fought the Minotaur. He killed the monster. Suzanne thinks the heroine of The Hunger Games, Katniss, is like a future Theseus."}

All year long, groups of people organise to share or fix things they already have."}
{"text_id": "34-a2", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or crime? It depends on how people see it. But in many countries, writing or painting on other people’s buildings or places without permission is a crime. Many street artists have been stopped by the police and had to pay money as a punishment. Many cities say it costs a lot of money to clean graffiti from buildings, buses, and trains."}
{"text_id": "35-a2", "simplified": "The art world thinks graffiti and street art are becoming more valuable. They have big shows for street art in galleries in Paris, London, and Los Angeles. An American artist named Elura Emerald had a street art show in New York in 2008. She said street artists just want to share their thoughts and do not hurt anyone. People should like and celebrate them."}
{"text_id": "36-a2", "simplified": "Most people have four to six dreams every night after they are ten years old. This means they can have about 2,000 dreams every year. By the time they are 80 years old, a person may have had 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget most of our dreams, we still remember some thousands in our life. It is not strange that sometimes a dream seems to happen in real life, especially if it is about something we see or do often."}

There used to be a thirteenth district, but it rebelled and was destroyed."}
{"text_id": "38-a2", "simplified": "Wild animals sometimes come to cities looking for food. In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons have been coming into people's areas near the city to find food. They open garbage cans and eat fruit from gardens. Some baboons even go into houses and take food from kitchens! Baboons can be very aggressive and have hurt many pet animals. This is why many city people don't like them coming into their homes."}

Luke begins his hero journey."}
{"text_id": "41-a2", "simplified": "Another idea to stop a PHA that might hit Earth is to use a nuclear weapon. It sounds like a movie. A real NASA plan called HAMMER uses small rockets. The rockets weigh eight tons. They will fire at the asteroid. The aim is to change the asteroid’s path. If the asteroid is too close, the rockets will carry bombs. The bombs will explode the asteroid. This is a real defence idea."}

When we wake up, we try to make these random things into a story."}

There were many distractions. I had housework to do. I wanted another cup of tea. My family needed my attention. Then, I went to a café near my house to work. The Wi-Fi was not good there. I also drank too much coffee. Finally, I rented a desk in a co-working space. Five other freelancers work there too. I like getting dressed to go to work. I can also focus better in the office."}

{"text_id": "47-a2", "simplified": "The “buy nothing” trend is now popular with people who post on social media. They usually show clothes and makeup that people should buy. Some YouTube stars now tell their fans not to buy anything for up to a year. Two friends in Canada tried it. In the first three months they only bought food and did not buy clothes, electronics, or house items. After that they stopped using services like haircuts, eating out, or buying petrol for cars. In one year they saved about $55,000."}

He becomes friends with a Christian priest and a Muslim baker. People are surprised when Pi says he follows Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity at the same time. When his family and teachers ask him to pick only one religion, Pi says no. He says, “I just want to love God.” After that, his family and teachers let Pi choose his own religion."}
{"text_id": "49-a2", "simplified": "Some people believe writing down your dreams helps you have lucid dreams. In lucid dreams, you know you're dreaming and can control what happens. You can turn nightmares into peaceful dreams or change the story like a movie director. Instead of just understanding your dreams, you can create them. But it’s still good to have some dreams that let you discover what’s on your mind."}
{"text_id": "50-a2", "simplified": "People may think their donated clothes help the environment. They give clothes to charities. But charity shops cannot sell all of them. Fast fashion changes style quickly. Those clothes are often low quality. People do not want to buy them used. Many clothes are thrown away. Some clothes that charities cannot sell are sent to other countries. This makes more money and environmental problems."}

She also ran a race in the Sahara Desert in very hot weather. Her most amazing journey was skiing to the South Pole. On the first day, she fell into a glacier and had to be rescued. But she kept going. After forty days, she reached the South Pole, pulling a sledge with her tent and food through cold and icy storms."}

She thinks this shows that life changes all the time with endings and new starts."}
{"text_id": "55-a2", "simplified": "Before, Gabriela worked in a place where people respected power and leaders made all the important decisions. In that place, people did not often question their bosses. But her new team in Sweden works differently. There, bosses and workers work together to find answers and make decisions. Bosses act like teachers who want workers to think for themselves and to share their ideas."}
{"text_id": "56-a2", "simplified": "When Gabriela saw that she and her team were different because of culture, she decided to talk with them. She asked how they felt about her leading. Her team was happy to share their ideas. They said they did not like being told exactly what to do. They liked to have freedom to be creative and make their own decisions. When Gabriela told them clearly what to do, they thought she did not trust them. They also saw that Gabriela felt bad when they asked questions or wanted to change her decisions. They explained that this was how they usually worked."}

Most street artists are young and work in their own city or neighbourhood. More and more artists are going to other cities and countries to paint. Some artists use the internet to talk to each other and show pictures of their work. People are also giving street art more respect as a real kind of art. Even though we do not know everything that will happen, street art will probably stay an important part of the world."}

One idea is that the dogs use their strong sense of smell. They may smell the places they like. Another idea is that the dogs hear the names of stations on the train announcements. People who travel on the metro now see dogs on the trains often. They do not pay much attention to the dogs anymore."}

This spending has two serious problems.   First, many people use credit cards to buy clothes. Right now, British adults owe about £670 to credit card companies. This is a lot of the money they spend on clothes each year.  Second, people are buying things they do not really need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year. Most of this ends up in landfill sites."}

In nature, these animals sometimes can't find partners to have babies with, or they might be in danger from poachers, losing their homes, or from predators. Zoos give them a safe place to live and have babies. Also, as wild animals become fewer, their babies might start looking too much alike. Breeding in zoos helps to keep the animals different and healthy. When there are enough zoo-bred animals, they can be set free to help wild groups become stronger and more different from each other."}

Boats can fall a bridge because they are very big.   To stop bridges from falling, we need to plan well.   We can use new tools to check if a bridge is weak.   Safer work places and better designs also help.   This can stop terrible accidents."}

In dreams, these thoughts show up as symbols, which are pictures or signs that mean something. When we are awake, we think mostly in words, like talking to ourselves inside our head. But when we sleep, the part of the brain that helps with language works less. At the same time, the part that controls feelings works more."}
{"text_id": "91-a2", "simplified": "Having good relationships helps people to be happy. Many happy people spend time with their family and friends often. You need at least one person to talk about your feelings. This is called “self-disclosure.” One close friend is enough, but you also need other friends for fun and talks. It is not enough to have many friends only to do activities or talk about music or sports. A deep connection with someone is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen well to build stronger friendships."}

Many people say things like, \"You are good at details\" or \"You are good at organizing.\" But research says that it’s better to praise how someone does something. For example, we can say “You worked hard” or “You tried something new” or “You solved a problem.” This can help people learn new skills and keep learning."}

He helped the police find the people. He looked at the CCTV film for six months. He was able to name 190 people. He could see them from their eyes. His help was very important for the police. The police used computer software to look at 200,000 hours of footage. The software only found one person. Gary’s work was much better."}

How can we expect teenagers not to text during homework when they see their parents using phones while cooking or waiting at a stoplight? The speaker also said people want to be in many places at once. So, they change quickly between talking in real life and talking online. I see this with my teenage daughter and her friends. They meet in person but sit quietly while each talks to other people on their phones."}

Today there are still civil wars, but most countries live together more peacefully.   In the last few years, terrorism has increased.   Since World War II, wars have killed more civilians than soldiers.   For civilians, the news is not all bad.   Violent crime kills nine times more people than political conflict.   The world murder rate has gone down a little.   It was 8 deaths per 100,000 people in 2000 and about 5.3 in 2015."}

More girls go to school. Many people now have clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-a2", "simplified": "Many managers give feedback. Sometimes, they put a bad comment between two good comments. This is like putting sugar on something that is not good.

It should make them feel good about what they are doing well."}

Instead, think about robots used for war now, like flying robots (drones) or robots with guns. These robots don’t need many people telling them what to do. Soon, there will be robots that can decide on their own who to kill – we call them ‘murderbots’. It’s not a good idea to let robots make these choices. We should be very careful about what we ask robots to do."}

Behind the easy rock music are stories about people who do hard work but do not get rich. Many songs show people who are angry because life is not good. The song “Glory Days” is about people in a small town looking back at when they were young and had everything. The song “Downbound Train” tells the story of a man who loses his job and his life changes. The singer talks about real people he knows and about a life he might have had if he had not become famous. The album shows the singer’s special and great talent."}

{"text_id": "111-a2", "simplified": "In old horror movies, the main characters could not call for help when they were in danger.   Now we have mobile phones, so that idea feels less real.   To keep the story exciting, the hero must have no phone signal.   In a scary film, the hero will almost always lose signal when they need help.   Sometimes the phone battery dies at the same time.   It can also happen that both the signal and the battery fail."}

Spider bites can hurt, but they are rarely deadly. The Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia was very dangerous before 1981. Since then, a medicine called anti-venom has stopped deaths from its bites. Be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel scared, they throw out tiny, itchy hairs. These hairs can stick to your skin or eyes and cause irritation."}

{"text_id": "115-a2", "simplified": "To understand where our ability to speak complex languages came from, we need to look at what makes our brains different from other animals. It’s not just about brain size, but also about what our brains can do. There are few physical clues left behind. Artifacts from our ancestors don’t tell us what sounds they could make. But we can see changes in the mouth, throat, and tongue in early humans. Around 100,000 years ago, humans could create complex sounds. Before that, scientists aren't sure if early humans communicated with basic sounds."}

{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified": "The speaker said many true things. I think we may feel more alone when we are connected. This is not a big problem for my age group. We can be alone and we know it is okay. Young people under 20 are different. They use phones a lot. They do not feel lonely. They also do not learn to enjoy being by themselves. They write messages that can be changed. This stops them from learning real talking with someone in front of them."}

Last year, when one of Martin's rats had babies, Chloe decided to adopt two of them."}
{"text_id": "25-b1", "simplified": "Cape Town can be dangerous for baboons. They get hurt or even killed in car accidents and sometimes they touch electric wires and get electrocuted. Baboons are endangered, so the city council hired Baboon Monitors to help. These monitors chase baboons away from the city or catch them and let them go in the countryside. This has worked somewhat, but it's tough to stop baboons from returning when they see the city as an easy source of food."}

The horses kicked and moved their tails to get rid of flies. They did not seem to care that their owner was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter only came outside when he had to, and Sam was okay with that. The more Mr. Carter stayed away, the longer Sam could keep his job. Mr. Carter wiped sweat from the back of his neck.

In response to the protests, the city council decided to try something more peaceful. Instead of shooting them, they put up fences and made it illegal to feed the pigs. It's still unclear if this strategy will work. Warmer winters mean that there are more pigs than before, which could make it difficult."}
{"text_id": "31-b1", "simplified": "Suzanne Collins got inspiration for the Hunger Games from Greek myths she loved as a child. One such myth is the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. In the story, Athens was ruled by Crete, and as punishment for rebellion, Athens had to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people were put in a maze and eaten by a monster there. However, Theseus, one of the youths, managed to kill the monster. Suzanne thinks of Katniss Everdeen as a future version of Theseus."}

Throughout the year, groups organize the sharing and fixing of things they already own."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Graffiti is often a tricky question: whether it’s art or vandalism depends on how you look at it. In many places, writing or painting on buildings or other property is seen as vandalism. Police have stopped many street artists, and they sometimes have to pay money as a fine. City governments often complain because cleaning graffiti from buildings, buses, and trains costs a lot of money."}
{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "What do people in the art world think about graffiti and street art? Recently, many have started to see it as valuable art. Big exhibitions of street art have taken place in galleries in Paris, London, and Los Angeles. Elura Emerald, an American artist, showed street art in a New York gallery in 2008. She said that street artists are just expressing themselves and not harming anyone, so they should be appreciated and celebrated."}

More than 10,000 millennials took part in this study. They shared their views on the dangers and chances in today’s complex work world."}

They also survive violent storms and the extreme heat of the Pacific sun. Sometimes, Pi finds comfort in his three religions, but at other times, he feels very lonely and sad. Finally, the Mexican coast appears, and everything changes. It would be unfair to reveal the ending, so you must read the book yourself to discover what happens to Pi and Richard Parker when they see land."}

She wanted to enjoy the quiet time before the house filled with the evening noises of conversation, television, or her dad listening to his favourite jazz while he cooked dinner. She liked this time of day because she could play with her pet rats."}

Kids don't want to sit next to him, and he can see them staring and talking about him. Luckily, he makes friends with Jack and Summer. But even more, his classmates won't touch him for fear of catching 'the plague'. As the school year goes on, Auggie has many ups and downs until a traumatic event at a school camp changes everything."}

No matter how bored or rebellious a teenage boy might be, escaping on foot would be impossible. Sam looked at the biggest horse, which was kicking the ground with its hooves. \"Can the boy ride?\" Sam thought. A skilled rider could cause a lot of trouble out here, miles away from anyone. But perhaps there was even more trouble for someone who didn't know anything about horses and wanted to escape his father."}
{"text_id": "74-b1", "simplified": "More than 4,000 climbers, ranging in age from thirteen to eighty, have reached the top of Mount Everest. Climbing big mountains in cold weather and during violent storms is very dangerous. Even though it is risky, many of the best climbers now seek new challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, from Austria, discovered her love for mountain climbing when she was a teenager. After finishing school, she worked as a nurse, but she continued to climb mountains in her free time."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified": "After reaching the top of Mount Everest, Gerlinde chose to reach all fourteen peaks in the world that are higher than 8,000 metres. She does this without using oxygen tanks, which makes the climb much harder. High altitudes have very little oxygen, and that can hurt a person’s brain and body. Gerlinde uses her climbing fame to raise money for a charity that helps poor children and orphans in Nepal."}

For example, we might have a thick woollen coat that was once trendy, but we live in a tropical country and do not need it. We could also have an old smartphone that we replaced with a newer model, or a car that we only use on weekends. Sometimes, we even have a guest room that has turned into a storage room."}

Maybe they use their sense of smell to recognize their favorite spots. Or they might remember the station names they hear announced. Now, passengers are so used to seeing dogs on the metro that they usually don't pay much attention."}

{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In Britain, the average person spends more than £1,000 on new clothes each year. That is about four percent of what they earn. This looks small, but it hides two serious problems. First, many people pay for clothes with credit cards. British adults owe about £670 to credit‑card companies. That is 66 percent of the money they spend on clothes. Second, the money they borrow is used to buy things they do not really need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year, and most of it ends up in landfill sites."}

{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "One important job of modern zoos is helping with international breeding programmes, especially for animals that are endangered. In nature, some rare animals find it hard to find mates and have babies. They can also be in danger from people who hunt them illegally, lose their homes, or face predators. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies. Also, when wild animal numbers become very low, they can become too similar genetically, which is not healthy. Breeding programmes protect against this problem by allowing animals born in zoos to be released back into the wild to increase variety in their genes."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified": "Both accidents involving boats and trains causing bridges to collapse are very rare. However, they happen for different reasons. With trains, it’s the speed of the impact that can damage the bridge. For boats, it’s their large size that can cause the collapse, even if they’re moving slowly. The best way to prevent bridge failures is to plan ahead. Technologies that can find weaknesses, safer working conditions, and better designs can help reduce these accidents."}

Fortunately for Pi, the tiger, who he names Richard Parker, is seasick and has no immediate interest in eating him."}

Worried about what would happen, they decided to shut down the zoo and move to Canada. Some animals were sold to zoos in North America. The family left on a ship, taking the animals with them. On the way, a terrible storm appeared, and the ship sank. Unfortunately, Pi’s parents and the sailors drowned. Pi survived, finding himself in a small lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orang‑utan, and a huge tiger."}

{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Carol Dweck, a psychologist who talks about how people can grow and improve, says that our brains can learn new things and get better at things we weren't good at before. We often praise people for the things they do well naturally, like saying 'You are really good at seeing details' or 'You have a natural talent for organizing events'. But research shows that if we praise how people try and solve problems, we can help them learn new skills and get better at what they do."}

The amount of methane changes over the year, like a planet breathing in and out."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified": "Early in her career, psychologist Carol Dweck from Stanford gave ten‑year‑olds some problems that were a little too hard. One group liked the challenge. They said, “We enjoy difficult tasks.” They believed that with effort they could get better. Dweck calls this a “growth mindset.” These kids focus on what they can achieve in the future.  Another group felt judged by their intelligence. They thought they had failed and could not see how they could get better. Dweck says they have a “fixed mindset.” Some of them even said they might cheat later. Others tried to find a child who did worse than them, just to feel better about themselves."}

{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "It was a very interesting talk, and the speaker said some important things. Let’s talk about how parents affect their children. It’s hard to expect teenagers to not use their phones when they’re doing homework if they see their parents using social media while cooking or waiting in the car. The speaker also said people want to be in many places at the same time. So, they switch between talking in real life and on their phones. I see this all the time with my daughter and her friends. They plan to meet up, but then they sit quietly while each person talks to someone else on their phone."}

Today there are still civil wars, but most countries share the world more peacefully. In recent years, terrorism has increased, and since World II more civilians than soldiers have died in wars. Even for civilians the numbers are not all bad. Deaths from violent crime are nine times higher than from political conflict, but the worldwide murder rate has gone down a little, from 8 per 100 000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}

Six million fewer children die each year from diseases, millions more girls are in school, and millions have clean water now."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "Many managers give negative feedback by starting and ending with something positive. They do this to make the criticism seem less harsh. But when this becomes a habit, employees start to think the positive comments are just a way to soften the negative feedback. So, they might not see the positive comments as genuine praise. Positive feedback should instead be given to really encourage and support good work, not just to make negative feedback easier to hear."}

Instead, think about robots being used now, like drones and robots with guns, that can kill without people telling them what to do. The next step is robots that can decide who to kill on their own. It seems to me this would be very bad and unfair to people. We should be careful about what we ask machines to do."}

{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "Born in the USA is a fast and exciting rock album, but its words have strong feelings. Behind the catchy rock music are stories about the hard and difficult side of the American dream. Many songs talk about the problems of regular working people and the sadness and anger they feel when life does not bring them money or success. For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town who remember when they were young and had many opportunities. The song Downbound Train tells about a young man whose life becomes very bad after he loses his job. It is easy to think the artist is telling stories about real people he knew and about the life he might have had if he had not become famous. This album shows clearly the special and great talent of the Boss."}

For example, he has seen coral reefs that are bleached because of warmer water, and he has seen underwater areas in the Red Sea that are empty and covered in plastic trash. Lewis believes nature can recover if it is given space, but time is running out. If we don’t take care of our oceans soon, we might face a big problem that is too hard to solve."}

But now, with mobile phones, this seems less real. To keep the story exciting, the solution is no phone signal! If you are a hero in a horror film, at the important moment when you need to call for help, you will not have any signal. Or your phone battery will die just as you try to call. Sometimes both happen."}

Now, the same problem is happening again with Big Mike's replacement, the Cavendish banana. Gros Michel was popular because its bananas were thick-skinned, sweet, and easy to transport. The main company growing and selling these bananas was United Fruit. They grew bananas by making copies from the stems of plants instead of using seeds, and they planted many plants very close together in their fields."}

Only about 25 spider species make venom that could be harmful to humans. Even if you get bitten by a spider, it's usually not very dangerous.   Australia has a famous spider, the Sydney funnel-web spider. Since they created a special medicine (anti-venom) in 1981, this spider hasn’t caused any deaths. However, it’s important to be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel threatened, they can protect themselves. They throw a cloud of tiny, prickly hairs at the person trying to hurt them. These hairs stick to the attacker’s skin or eyes."}
{"text_id": "114-b1", "simplified": "This idea is a common pattern in horror movies from the 1990s. It begins with a group of teenagers having fun. Then, almost everyone dies, and only one girl survives. In the first scenes, the girl is usually shy, innocent, and not very strong. By the end of the movie, she has become the toughest and most clever person. In almost every story, the last girl wins."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "If we want to find out where our ability to speak complex languages came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. It’s not just about how big our brains are; it’s important what else our brains can do and when they started to develop. There are very few clues about this in the past. Old tools and objects left by our ancestors don't tell us how well they could speak. However, we can see that early humans developed their mouths, throats, and tongues about 100,000 years ago. At that time, they could start making complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if they were using simpler sounds to talk."}

There are also few positive female role models in science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often feature male scientists or inventors. Additionally, scientists are seen as socially awkward and their work as lonely. These false stereotypes from the media can make science seem unappealing to girls. If girls saw more women succeeding in science, they would feel more confident and belong more in those subjects."}

This isn't as big of a problem for my generation since we grew up without much technology. We know how to be alone and understand that it's okay. But young people under 20 are different. They are always communicating but rarely experience solitude. They might not learn to enjoy being alone. Also, they're learning to communicate through edited messages instead of in real conversations with people in front of them."}
