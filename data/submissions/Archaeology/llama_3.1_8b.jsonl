In 2000, 8 people out of 100,000 were killed in violent crime. In 2015, this number went down to about 5.3 people."}

The city council listened to the complaints and decided to do something different. They put up fences to keep the pigs out and made it against the rules to give them food. We will see if this new plan works, but it might be hard to stop the pigs because winters are getting warmer and there are more of them than before."}
{"text_id": "31-b1", "simplified": "Suzanne Collins, the author of The Hunger Games, was inspired by classical Greek mythology. One of her favourite stories as a child was about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, the city of Athens is ruled by Crete, but the people of Athens rebel against the ruler, Minos. As a punishment, Minos makes the Athenians send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. The young people are then thrown into a maze called the labyrinth, where a monster called the Minotaur eats them. However, one of the youths, named Theseus, fights the Minotaur and kills it. Suzanne sees Katniss Everdeen as a brave and strong character, similar to Theseus."}

Throughout the year, groups of people who support this movement share and fix things they already own."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? It's up to you to decide. However, in many places, writing or painting on public or private property is seen as vandalism. Many street artists have been caught by the police and some have had to pay a fine. This is because city councils say it's expensive to clean graffiti off buildings, buses, and trains."}
{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "The art world's view on graffiti and street art is changing. Many people now see it as a valuable art form. In recent years, there have been big exhibitions of street art in galleries in Paris, London, and Los Angeles. In 2008, an American artist named Elura Emerald organised a street art show in a New York gallery. She believed that street artists should be respected because they are just expressing themselves and not causing any harm."}
{"text_id": "36-b1", "simplified": "Most people have four to six dreams every night after they reach ten years old. This means they have approximately 2,000 dreams each year. By the time they are 80 years old, the average person might have had around 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget 95-99 per cent of our dreams, we still remember a few thousand across our lifetime. It's not surprising that people often notice strange coincidences, like a dream event being followed by a similar real-life event, especially if the dream is about something that happens frequently in their daily lives, which can make it seem like a coincidence is more likely to happen."}

However, baboons can be aggressive and have injured many pet animals, so many city residents do not want them in the area."}

{"text_id": "41-b1", "simplified": "One way to stop a large asteroid from hitting the Earth is to destroy it with a nuclear explosion. This might sound like a plot from a science fiction film, but it's actually a real plan that NASA has considered. They call it the HAMMER plan.\n\nTo achieve this, they would send powerful rockets towards the asteroid to try and alter its path. If the asteroid is close to Earth, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs to prevent it from causing any damage."}
{"text_id": "42-b1", "simplified": "The hero in a story often starts by saying no to a big opportunity, but then a wise person helps them and they decide to take the risk. They go into a new and exciting world where the adventure takes place. The next step is to face challenges and make difficult choices. The hero might meet new friends who help them, but they will also meet people who want to stop them. For Luke Skywalker, the wise person was Obi-Wan, his friends were Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO, and the person trying to stop him was Darth Vader inside the Death Star."}

{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, people thought that dreams were important. They believed that things we see in our dreams can tell us things we don't know about ourselves. This idea is that understanding our dreams can help us understand our feelings and problems. But another idea was that dreams are just a mix of things our brain does when we're sleeping. Our brain organises memories while we sleep, and when we wake up, we try to make sense of the images and feelings."}

However, the Wi-Fi was not good and I drank too much coffee. I then decided to rent a desk in a shared office with five other freelancers. I liked getting dressed to go to work and being able to focus in a quiet office."}

{"text_id": "49-b1", "simplified": "Some people think writing down their dreams can help them control them better. When you have a lucid dream, you know you're dreaming and can choose what happens.

{"text_id": "50-b1", "simplified": "People might not know they're contributing to the problem of disposable clothing because they donate their old clothes to charity. However, charities can't sell all the clothes they receive. Fast fashion is trendy for a short time, but it's often low quality and can't be recycled. As a result, many of these clothes are thrown away, and some are sent to other countries, causing more economic and environmental issues."}

She has climbed the highest mountain on each continent, cycled across Canada, and completed a long-distance race in extremely hot conditions in the Sahara Desert. However, her most impressive journey was a skiing trip to the South Pole. On the first day, she had a serious accident while skiing into a glacier and had to be rescued. Many people would have given up at that point, but Meagan decided to continue. She eventually reached the South Pole after forty days, pulling a sledge with a tent and food through harsh weather and ice storms."}

However, it's even harder for him because of the way he looks. Nobody wants to sit next to him and he notices kids staring at him or talking about him behind their hands. Fortunately, he makes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he chats with at lunch. But things don't get easier. Auggie's classmates are afraid to touch him because they think he might catch something. Throughout the school year, Auggie goes through many difficult times. Then, a traumatic event happens at a school camp that changes everything."}

However, no matter how bored or rebellious a teenage boy might be, it was impossible to escape on foot. Sam looked at the biggest horse, which was kicking its legs with its heavy hooves. Could the boy ride? he thought. There was a lot of trouble a good rider could get into out here, far from anyone. But there might also be trouble for someone who didn't know how to ride and wanted to get away from his father."}
{"text_id": "74-b1", "simplified": "Over 4,000 people have successfully climbed Mount Everest, with ages varying from 13 to 80. While climbing high mountains in harsh weather conditions is still extremely hazardous, many experienced climbers now seek new and exciting challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner, an Austrian climber, began her mountaineering career as a teenager. After completing her education, she worked as a nurse, but she continued to climb mountains in her free time because she enjoys it."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified": "Gerlinde climbed Mount Everest and then decided to tackle all 14 mountains over 8,000 metres high. She makes it even more challenging by climbing without oxygen tanks, which is a big risk because high mountains can cause problems with your brain and body. In fact, she uses her climbing fame to help a charity that supports poor children and orphans in Nepal."}

We might have a thick coat that looks nice but is useless here, a phone that we replaced with a newer one, a car that only gets used on weekends, or a spare room that's now a storage space."}
{"text_id": "77-b1", "simplified": "Throughout history and across cultures, people have thought that dreams are connected to the future. They believed that dreams are messages from a higher power, sent to help us understand or learn something new. Many people can remember a time when they dreamed about something and then it actually happened in real life."}

{"text_id": "80-b1", "simplified": "Dogs that live in groups have learned that people are more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs. So, these dogs are sent to beg for food for the whole group. Some dogs have even learned to use the city's metro to travel from one part of their territory to another. Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their sense of smell to find their favourite places. Another possibility is that they have learned to recognize the names of stations they hear in announcements. This way, they can get to where they want to go. Now, metro passengers are used to seeing dogs on the trains, so they don't usually notice them."}
{"text_id": "81-b1", "simplified": "Ed Stafford, a British explorer, made history by becoming the first person to walk along the entire length of the Amazon River. He started his incredible journey at a tiny stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and successfully completed it two years and four months later, after covering an impressive 6,000 kilometres. The Amazon rainforest is known for being a hazardous environment, home to deadly creatures such as poisonous snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars. Fortunately, Ed managed to avoid any serious harm and only suffered a few thousand mosquito and ant bites during his adventure."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In the UK, people spend over £1,000 on new clothes each year. This is about four per cent of their income. While it doesn't seem like a lot, this figure hides two big problems. First, many people use credit cards to buy clothes. On average, each adult in the UK owes £670 to credit card companies. This is more than half of the money people spend on new clothes. Additionally, people are buying things they don't need and can't afford. As a result, the UK throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year, most of which ends up in landfill sites."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified": "Ed's walk would have been very hard without technology. He used a radio to ask the people of the rainforest for food and permission to cross their land. They came to meet him and helped him through the toughest parts. Ed also kept a blog, writing about his daily adventures. He used the attention from the media to speak out against the destruction of the rainforest and to collect money for charities that help the environment and children in Brazil and Peru."}
{"text_id": "84-b1", "simplified": "Companies are now using the sharing economy because it can be profitable. They want to use things that are not being used. One idea is to create a website that connects people who need something with people who can offer it. For example, Airbnb helps people earn money by renting out their empty rooms and houses. Uber is another example - it lets people use their own cars to give passengers a lift and earn some extra money."}
{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "Zoos play a vital role in helping endangered species. In the wild, some of these species have trouble finding partners and reproducing because they are hunted, lose their homes, and have many predators. A good zoo gives these animals a safe place to live and have babies. \n\nThis is especially important when some wild animal populations are getting smaller. If they become too similar, it can be bad for them. Zoos help by breeding animals in a safe environment. Then, some of these animals can be released back into the wild to make the populations more diverse."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified": "Both types of accidents are very rare, but they happen for different reasons. Boats can cause a bridge to collapse because of their big size, even if they're moving slowly. Trains can cause a bridge to fall down because of their speed. We need to be prepared for these accidents. Using modern technology to find weak points, creating safer workplaces and designing bridges better can all help to prevent these terrible accidents."}

However, he soon remembers that there are sharks in the water, which makes him decide it's safer to return to the lifeboat. Unfortunately, the animals in the lifeboat start to fight each other, and one by one, they get killed. Eventually, only Pi and the tiger are left. It's fortunate for Pi that the tiger, which he later names Richard Parker, is unwell and not hungry at that moment."}
{"text_id": "88-b1", "simplified": "When Pi is 16, his parents disagree with the new government and are concerned about the future. They decide to leave the country and move to Canada, but things don't go as planned. They sell some animals to zoos in North America and take the rest with them on a ship. Unfortunately, the ship hits a storm and sinks, resulting in the death of Pi's family and the sailors on board. However, Pi manages to survive in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orang-utan, and a big tiger."}

Since its release in 2008, it has been translated into 26 languages and has sold millions of copies globally. This is remarkable, especially considering it was the first young adult book to sell over a million e-books. The novel was also adapted into a successful film, which performed similarly to the book. In its opening weekend in North America, the film earned a significant 152.5 million dollars."}
{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified": "Maybe our dreams are a result of our brain sorting out things we think about during the day. However, in dreams, these thoughts appear with special meanings. When we're awake, our thoughts are like conversations in our minds. But when we sleep, the part of our brain that handles language gets quieter, while the part that deals with emotions gets stronger."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "Building strong relationships is crucial for our overall happiness. People who feel content often make time for their friends and family, which helps them feel more connected. Having someone to talk to is beneficial, whether it's one close friend or a group of people. It's not just about sharing activities or discussing hobbies; we also need to feel a sense of closeness and understanding with each other. Some individuals need to work on improving their listening skills to build stronger and more meaningful relationships."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Carol Dweck, a psychologist who supports the 'growth mindset', says our brains can change and we can learn new skills, even if we weren't good at them at first. We often praise people for their natural talents, like being good at details or organisation. But research shows that if we praise how they work, like their effort and problem-solving skills, we can help them learn new things and improve their talents."}
{"text_id": "93-b1", "simplified": "The Mars rover checks the Martian atmosphere often. In 2014, it found something interesting - methane was present. Methane is also found in natural gas on Earth. However, methane in the air doesn't last long. It disappears in a few hundred years. This means there must be a source of methane on Mars. Scientists think Mars releases methane sometimes, and the amount of methane in the air changes throughout the year. This is similar to how the Earth's atmosphere changes with the seasons."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified": "Carol Dweck, a psychologist from Stanford University, gave a group of ten-year-olds some difficult problems to solve. She wanted to see how they would react. One group enjoyed the challenge and thought that they could get better at solving problems. They believed in a 'growth mindset', which means they focus on what they can achieve in the future. \n\nHowever, another group felt stressed and thought that their intelligence was being tested. They had a 'fixed mindset' and thought that they couldn't improve. Some of these children even thought about cheating in the future. Others looked for someone who did worse than them to make themselves feel better."}
{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified": "Horror movies often take place in empty buildings. This could be an old hospital, a deserted house, or a town with no people. There's something about quiet, empty spaces. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they move away? Maybe it's also because these places are so quiet, which can be very frightening too. Abandoned places are also useful for film directors, as it's believable that there will be no phone signal there."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified": "People find basements frightening in horror movies. This is often because something is hidden there or because the villain has left their tools. Basements are usually dark and damp. You have to go down a narrow staircase to get to them. Even when there's nothing down there, basements still feel creepy."}
{"text_id": "97-b1", "simplified": "Gary Collins, a policeman not working, saw the London riots on TV. He knew some people and decided to cut his holiday short to help identify them. He spent six months looking at CCTV footage and was able to identify 190 people, often just from their eyes. His help was very important for the investigation. Even with 200,000 hours of footage, computers were only able to identify one person."}
{"text_id": "98-b1", "simplified": "I think it's really interesting to think about how we'll improve ourselves as humans by adding technology to our bodies. Just imagine if we could put a computer inside our brain! In the future, we'll be able to do this and it will make us better at maths, help us see and hear things more clearly, and remember things more easily. This idea will become more normal over time."}
{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "It was a great talk and the speaker made some good points. For example, how can we expect teenagers not to text while doing their homework when they see their parents using their phones all the time? They might see their parents checking their phones while cooking dinner or waiting at a traffic light. The speaker also said that people often want to be in two places at once. So, they switch between their real-life conversations and their online ones. I've seen this with my daughter and her friends. They plan to meet, but then they all sit together and chat online while each one talks to someone else."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "There's a mix of good and bad news when it comes to violence in the world. Between World War II and 1990, there were 30 big wars that killed over 100,000 people. However, things have improved since then. Most countries are now getting along better than they used to. But terrorism has become a big problem in recent years. Since World War II, many more civilians have died in wars than soldiers. On the other hand, the number of people killed in violent crime is still a major issue. Although it's nine times more likely to die in a violent crime than in a war, the murder rate has actually decreased slightly. It went from 8 deaths per 100,000 people in 2000 to around 5.3 in 2015."}

She has seen many international projects in her country that teach and train women and girls, but often these projects stop and leave them with nothing. Wasfia thought that Bangladesh needed to stand up for itself, so she combined her two interests, mountaineering and helping people's rights, to try and change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing while working on humanitarian projects in Tibet and Nepal because in Bangladesh, most people don't see mountains as they live in a flat country near the sea. Her campaign seems to be working as more and more people in Bangladesh and around the world are taking notice."}
{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "Most people think that countries with limited financial resources are struggling. They assume these countries are poor, often controlled by strict leaders, and have little chance of getting better. But this isn't entirely true. Something good is happening. Over the past 20 years, over 700 million people have seen their income rise and moved out of poverty. As a result, six million fewer children die each year because of illness. Many more girls are getting an education now, and millions of people have access to clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "Many managers try to make their feedback more positive by giving two nice comments and one not-so-nice comment. But when feedback is always the same, employees start to think that the nice comments are just a way to hide the bad ones. This makes the nice comments less useful. We should give positive feedback to help and encourage people to do their jobs well, not just to make the bad news easier to hear."}

While some people think of robots like the Terminator, the reality is that military machines like drones and sentry robots are already being used to kill with very little human control. If we allow machines to decide who to kill on their own, it would be completely wrong and a danger to humanity. We need to be careful about what we ask machines to do."}

{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "Born in the USA is a popular rock album with powerful songs that also have a lot of feeling. Behind the catchy music are stories about the problems of ordinary people who work hard but don't get rich or famous. Many songs talk about how people feel angry and disappointed when their lives don't go as they hoped. The song Glory Days is about people looking back at their younger days when they thought they had everything, while Downbound Train tells the story of a young man who loses his job and his life falls apart. You can imagine that the singer is writing about real people he knows and the life he might have had if he hadn't become famous. This album shows how talented the singer is."}

The Gros Michel banana plant was successful because its fruit was easy to transport, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet. Many plantations in Central America grew this type of banana. A big company called United Fruit found a way to grow them quickly. They copied the banana plants instead of growing them from seeds, which helped them produce a lot of bananas in a small area.\n\n"}

You should be careful because spider bites can still be very painful. For example, the Sydney funnel-web spider hasn't killed anyone in Australia since a medicine was found to stop its venom in 1981. Some spiders, like tarantulas, can release tiny hairs when they feel scared. These hairs can be very annoying and get stuck in your skin or eyes."}

{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "To understand where our ability for complex language came from, we need to look at how our brains are different from other animals. This isn't just about brain size; it's also about what else our brains can do and when they developed those skills. Unfortunately, there aren't many physical clues to help us understand this. We can't learn much from the things our ancestors left behind, like tools or houses, because these don't tell us how they spoke. However, we can see that early humans developed their mouths, throats, and tongues over time. By about 100,000 years ago, humans had the ability to make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only make educated guesses about how early humans communicated."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "It's our society, not nature, that tells us girls should be good at arts and humanities, and that boys are better at maths and physics. This is also because we don't often see positive female role models doing science-related jobs. Cartoons and stories often show men as crazy scientists, genius inventors, or adventurous astronauts. People also think that scientists are not very social, or that their work is lonely. These ideas are not true, but they can make girls think that science is not a good career choice for them. If we saw more women doing science, it would make girls feel more confident and like they belong in those subjects."}

Some students also find it inconvenient to obtain a copy because they need to go to the university to pick one up. As a result, many copies end up as litter on campus."}

{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified": "A lot of what the speaker said makes sense. I think it's true that being more connected can make us feel more alone. I don't see this as a big problem for my age group because we didn't grow up with technology. We know how to be by ourselves and it's okay to be alone. However, younger people are different. They're always communicating and don't get the chance to be alone, which is necessary to learn how to enjoy their own company. Also, they learn how to talk through messages that can be changed, rather than having real conversations with people in front of them."}
