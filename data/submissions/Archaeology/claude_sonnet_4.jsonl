This is 66 per cent of their clothes money. So people spend money they don't have. The second problem is about waste. People buy clothes they don't need. Then they throw away these clothes.

This can happen when the boat moves very slowly too. The best way to stop bridge problems is to plan for them. We have new machines now that can find weak parts in bridges.

In Moscow, there are about 35,000 wild dogs that live on the streets, although many people don't know about them. Some of these dogs were born wild, while others used to be family pets that their owners have abandoned or left behind. Some dogs prefer to live alone, but others have formed groups because it helps them survive better in the busy city.\n\nIn 2010, scientists studied these dogs and discovered something quite amazing about their behavior. The dogs have learned to live very successfully in the city environment, even though it is completely different from their natural habitat. They have figured out that it is much safer to cross busy streets when people are crossing too, since cars will stop for humans. Some dogs have even learned to watch traffic lights and seem to understand when the lights change from red to green, which shows they can recognize patterns.\n\nThis example demonstrates how clever animals can be when they need to adapt to survive in a completely new environment, and it proves that wildlife might be more intelligent than we usually think."}

On her website, she explains that the idea for the book came to her after she saw a girl with facial differences on the street one day. The girl's appearance was different from other people's faces, and this experience inspired Palacio to write her story. Wonder has been extremely popular in the United States and has already won several important awards for children's literature. Many schools have started using it to begin discussions about bullying, friendship and what it feels like when you are different from others in your community. Although the book deals with serious topics, it presents them in a way that young readers can understand and connect with. Someone is currently making a film adaptation of the book, and many people, including me, are eagerly waiting to see what RJ Palacio will write next because we really want to read her new stories and characters."}

She knows that most people don't choose rats as pets, and she has tried to explain many times that rats are actually clean animals. She tells people that rats can be wonderful pets if you take care of them properly. However, Chloe understands why people have bad feelings about rats because she used to feel the same way.\n\nBefore she got her rats, Chloe didn't like them either. Everything changed when her friend Martin showed her his pet rats. She could see that the rats were very loving and smart animals. This experience made her think differently about rats as pets. Last year, one of Martin's rats had baby rats, so Chloe decided that she would like to have two of them for herself."}
{"text_id": "25-b1", "simplified": "Cape Town can be a dangerous place for baboons. Some baboons have been hurt or killed in car accidents, while others have died because they played with electric cables. Baboons are animals that might disappear forever if we don't protect them. The city council has decided to help these animals and reduce problems between humans and baboons, so they have given jobs to a team called Baboon Monitors. These monitors must chase baboons away from city areas or catch them so they can let them go free in the countryside. This plan has worked quite well, although it is still difficult to stop baboons from returning to the city. The baboons come back because they think the city is a place where they can find food easily."}

This means that I don't need to spend time traveling to work or having small conversations with other workers. I work on different projects, and this freedom is very important to me because it means I can easily take time off when my children need me at their school shows or when I have to go to the dentist. However, the bad side is that I don't have clear working hours, so I often work until late in the evening. Sometimes I even miss dinner because I want to finish my work tasks."}
{"text_id": "27-b1", "simplified": "In the 1990s, graffiti has continued but there was also a big increase in street art around the world. Some artists wanted to make political points, so they created art that tried to make people think about war, unfair treatment and discrimination. Other street artists were more interested in making beautiful and attractive work. In South America, many street artists have gone to work in poor areas because they wanted to add colour, life and beauty to grey city walls."}

Mr Carter only came out to this place when he really had to, which was good for Sam. If he could stay away from his boss, he would keep his job longer. Mr Carter cleaned the sweat from his neck with his hand. The wet areas on his shirt were getting bigger and joining together. His skin was already getting red because of the hot June sun. You could see that he usually stayed inside - he looked like a man who made money while other people did all the hard work."}

Hunters and people who love animals had angry arguments about this problem. Because there were so many protests, the city council decided to use more peaceful ways to deal with the pigs. They have built fences instead of shooting the animals, and they have made a new law so that people cannot feed the pigs anymore. We will see if this plan works in the future, although it might be difficult to win this fight. This is because winters are getting warmer now, which means there are more pigs than there were before."}
{"text_id": "31-b1", "simplified": "The Hunger Games book has been influenced by Suzanne's passion for ancient Greek mythology, which she discovered during her childhood. When she was young, she became fascinated by the story about Theseus and the Minotaur. In this myth, the city of Athens had been defeated by another powerful place called Crete, although the Athenian people continued to resist this foreign control. Because they rebelled against their rulers, King Minos of Crete decided that he would punish them severely. He forced the people of Athens to send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year as a tribute. These young people were taken into a complicated maze where a dangerous half-man, half-bull creature called the Minotaur lived and devoured them. However, one brave young man called Theseus volunteered to go, and he managed to kill this terrifying monster. Suzanne believes that Katniss Everdeen represents a modern version of Theseus, even though her story takes place in a future world where technology has advanced."}
{"text_id": "32-b1", "simplified": "Zoos have created connections between people and animals, which means they can teach visitors about wildlife protection in meaningful ways. When people see animals at the zoo, they might understand why we should save endangered species and protect the natural places where they live. Some modern zoos have become safe homes for animals that people have treated badly in circuses or other entertainment places. They also help abandoned pets that their owners have left behind because they could not take care of them anymore.\n\nZoos do important research work as well, although many people don't know about this. Scientists study how animals behave and react in different situations, so they can learn more about animal psychology. They also research animal diseases and discover better ways to help sick animals recover completely. This research has helped many wild animals survive, even though some people believe that zoos are not suitable places for animals to live happily."}

The idea started in Canada in the early 1990s and then moved to the US. There it became a way to say no to spending too much money on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which happen during Thanksgiving weekend. On Buy Nothing Day, people organize different kinds of protests and they cut up their credit cards. During the whole year, Buy Nothing groups help people exchange things they already have and repair items that are broken."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? This depends on how you see it, but in many countries, writing or painting on public or private property is considered vandalism.

Many city councils complain about the high cost of cleaning graffiti off buildings, buses and trains."}
{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "What do people in the art world think about graffiti and street art? In recent years, more people have started to see it as real art. There have been big exhibitions of street art in art galleries in Paris, London and Los Angeles. The American artist Elura Emerald organized a street art exhibition at a New York gallery in 2008. She supported street artists and said that artists who paint on the street are just showing their feelings and ideas. She believed they are not hurting anyone, so people should like their work and celebrate what they do."}
{"text_id": "36-b1", "simplified": "If most people have four to six dreams every night after they turn ten years old, this means they will have about 2,000 dreams each year. So when they reach 80 years old, the average person might have experienced around 140,000 dreams during their lifetime. Although we forget 95 to 99 percent of our dreams, we could still remember several thousand dreams while we are alive. It should not be surprising that sometimes we have a dream and then something similar actually happens in real life. This is particularly true if the dream includes activities that happen regularly in our everyday life, because these situations are more likely to occur again in the future. However, this connection between dreams and reality might simply be a coincidence, since we dream about things we know well from our daily experiences."}

The country is called Panem and it has twelve poor districts that are controlled by the rich Capitol. The Capitol has complete power over the whole nation, so all districts must do what they say. Each district is responsible for making different products for the Capitol. District 12, where the story starts, gives all the coal to the country. There used to be a thirteenth district, but they fought against the Capitol in the past. Because of this rebellion, the Capitol destroyed them completely."}
{"text_id": "38-b1", "simplified": "Wild animals often come into cities because they need to find food, which has become a serious problem in many places. In Cape Town, South Africa, baboons have been moving into neighborhoods where people live near the city for several years now. They search for food there since their natural habitat doesn't provide enough anymore. The baboons have learned to open rubbish bins and they regularly eat fruit from people's gardens, although this damages the plants. Some baboons have become very confident, so they even break into houses when nobody is watching. They take food from kitchen cupboards and fridges, which causes expensive damage to people's homes! Baboons can be quite dangerous animals and they have attacked many pet cats and dogs in these areas. Because of this ongoing situation, most people who live in the city don't want the baboons there anymore. This reaction is easy to understand since the animals might seriously hurt their beloved pets or even small children."}

{"text_id": "40-b1", "simplified": "George Lucas was one of the first film directors who used the 17 stages of the hero's journey to build his story. Usually the hero begins the story while they are living a normal life, but then something happens that asks them to go on an adventure. This adventure will change everything in their life. At the start of Star Wars, Luke has been living a normal life with his aunt and uncle, and he spends his time fixing robots. However, when he discovers Princess Leia's message to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside the robot R2D2, this becomes 'the call to adventure'. This call is what starts the hero on their long journey."}
{"text_id": "41-b1", "simplified": "Another idea that people have talked about is to protect Earth from a dangerous space rock that might hit us. They want to destroy it with a nuclear weapon. This might sound like something from a movie, and it was the main story of the 1998 film Armageddon. However, there is a real plan that NASA has made called HAMMER. This means Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response.\n\nThe plan works like this: scientists would shoot heavy rockets at a space rock that is coming towards Earth. These rockets weigh eight tons each. Scientists hope this will push the space rock away from our planet so it cannot hit us. But if the space rock was too close to Earth, this pushing method would not work well enough. In that case, the rockets would carry nuclear bombs instead. Then they could blow up the space rock completely before it reaches Earth."}

After this, they decide to 'cross the threshold' and go into the 'special world' where the adventure takes place. The next part has tests that the hero must pass, enemies they have to fight and friends they meet while they get ready for their biggest challenge. For Luke, his teacher is Obi-Wan, his friends are Han Solo and the robots R2D2 and C3PO, and his enemy is Darth Vader. All of this happens in the special world of the Death Star."}

Since the internet has become popular, online communities have found a way to make money from sharing these unused items.

This is called the sharing economy."}
{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified": "Around the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams have become popular. One idea was that the things we see in our dreams show things that are hidden from our normal thinking. Freud believed that if we understand what dreams are telling us, we can understand our hidden feelings and the problems they might cause us. However, the other idea was completely different. It said that dreams are just a mix of random activity in the brain while it organizes memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to make sense of these random pictures and feelings, so we put them into some kind of story."}

At first, I was working from home, but I found it really hard to focus on my work. There were too many things that took my attention away from work: housework that I should do, making another cup of tea, my family members who wanted my help with different things. So I started to go to a café near my home to work, but the internet connection wasn't good and I drank too much coffee. In the end, I decided to rent a desk in a shared office space with five other freelancers like myself. I liked getting dressed to go to work in the morning, and I could focus much better in an office environment."}

This is a 0.5-metre space telescope that would use infrared light to find asteroids. If NASA gets the money, it could probably reach its goal in ten years. However, once they have recorded all the asteroids, the planetary defence team would still need to work out how to protect the planet. They must find ways to stop the really dangerous asteroids from hitting Earth - these are called PHAs."}

However, some YouTube stars now tell their viewers not to buy anything at all. They suggest doing this for periods as long as a year.\n\nTwo friends in Canada have spent a year trying to buy only food. For the first three months, they learned how to live without buying electrical things, clothes or items for their house. This was difficult because they had to change their daily habits completely.\n\nFor the next stage, they stopped paying for services. For example, they didn't get haircuts, eat out at restaurants or buy petrol for their cars. Although this was hard work, the results were amazing. In one year, they had saved $55,000 because they didn't spend money on things they didn't really need."}

His family follows the Hindu religion, which they have practiced for many years, but Pi wants to learn about other religions too because he is curious about different ways to believe in God. He becomes good friends with a Christian priest who teaches him about Jesus, and he also gets to know a Muslim baker who shows him Islamic prayers and traditions.\n\nEveryone in his community is quite surprised when Pi tells them that he considers himself Hindu, Muslim and Christian at the same time. His family members and teachers think this is strange, and they tell him that he should choose only one religion because most people believe you cannot follow three different religions together. However, Pi disagrees with them because he feels that all these religions help him love God in different ways, and he doesn't want to give up any of them.\n\nAfter Pi explains his feelings about religion, his family and teachers realize that they cannot change his mind. Although they still think his choice is unusual, they decide they will let him choose what he believes about religion by himself, since his faith seems genuine and important to him."}
{"text_id": "49-b1", "simplified": "Some people believe that if you write down your dreams, it might help you have lucid dreams. Lucid dreams are special dreams where you know that you are dreaming while the dream is happening. When you have this type of dream, you can also make choices that change what happens in your dream.\n\nFor example, you could turn a scary nightmare into a dream that feels safe and comfortable. You could also control your dream story like a movie director controls a film. However, you should probably still have some normal dreams too. These regular dreams are important because they let your subconscious mind show you what you are really thinking about. So instead of just trying to understand what your dreams mean after you wake up, you would actually be making your own dreams while you sleep."}

However, these charity shops cannot sell all the clothes that people bring to them. 'Fast fashion' means cheap clothes that become unfashionable very quickly, and the quality is often too bad to use again. People do not want to buy these clothes second-hand because they look worn out. Large amounts of these clothes have been thrown away as rubbish. Many clothes that charity shops cannot sell are sent to other countries, and this causes more problems for the economy and the environment there."}

Meagan McGrath from Canada has climbed the highest mountain on each continent. She has also ridden a bike across Canada and run a long-distance race in the Sahara Desert when it was 45ºC hot. However, her most incredible journey was probably a skiing trip to the South Pole. On the first day, she fell into a glacier and someone had to rescue her. Many of us would have stopped trying at that point, but Meagan decided to continue. She reached the South Pole forty days later, even though she had pulled a sledge with a tent and all her food behind her. She did this through very cold conditions and ice storms."}

{"text_id": "53-b1", "simplified": "In some areas, local governments have tried to help artists so they don't paint graffiti anywhere they want on walls. They have created special places where artists can work. Taiwan is one place that has done this, and there are 'graffiti zones' where artists can paint and write on walls without problems. In São Paulo in Brazil, the city council has even allowed some graffiti artists to paint on the subway trains. This shows that some cities want to give artists proper places to do their work."}

She paints large, colourful pictures of people and animals on walls, although she also likes to travel to different places to find new locations for her work. Her artwork can be discovered on pavements, inside empty factories, and even on old cars that previous owners have abandoned. \n\nShe actually enjoys the fact that most street art doesn't last forever, because weather conditions or city workers will eventually remove it. This temporary nature appeals to her since it represents how life is constantly changing, with things that come to an end while new experiences begin. Even though her paintings might disappear, she believes this process shows the natural cycle of life that we all experience."}

Her team was happy because she asked for their opinions, so they told her honestly what they thought. They said they were not used to having someone tell them exactly what to do. They liked having more freedom to use their own ideas and be creative in their work. When Gabriela gave them very specific instructions about what she needed them to do, they felt that she didn't trust them to do their jobs well.

Long ago, people in Africa and Europe painted pictures of animals and people inside caves because they wanted to tell stories about their lives. People have found graffiti on old buildings in countries like Greece, Italy, Syria and Iraq, although many of these writings are very old now.\n\nIn the Roman town of Pompeii, scientists who study ancient history have found many examples of graffiti that was written in Latin. These messages include different topics about religion, politics and love, and they even found some magic spells that people believed would help them! This graffiti is important because it shows us how ordinary people lived and what they thought about during those times."}

The scientists believe that when DART crashes into this moon, the impact will be strong enough to push it away from its usual path through space.

You should think carefully about the people who appeared in your dream and the place where everything happened, because these things might be important for understanding what the dream actually means. If you write down your dreams every day for a week, you will be surprised by how much you have written during that time. After you have done this for several days, you can start to connect your dreams to the things that happen in your real life and discover how you feel about them. Although dreams can seem strange, they often show us things about our emotions that we might not notice when we are awake.

Since the internet has become more popular, artists can now connect with each other online and share photographs of their artwork with people around the world. Even though street art was once considered illegal or unimportant, people in museums and galleries have begun to show more respect for this type of art because they believe it represents real artistic expression.

What makes Erik's story so amazing is that he has been completely blind since he was 13 years old, so he has achieved all these things without being able to see anything. When he is not traveling to different places around the world, he works hard to help other people with disabilities because he believes they should be able to live more active and exciting lives.

Luckily, he becomes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he talks with at lunch. But it's not just the first day that's difficult. Auggie soon finds out that his classmates don't want to touch him because they are afraid of catching 'the plague'. While he goes through the school year, Auggie has many strong good and bad times until finally something unexpected and shocking happens at a school camp that changes everything completely."}

However bored and angry a teenage boy might feel, he couldn't run away on foot from this place. Sam looked at the biggest horse, which was hitting the ground with its heavy feet. Could the boy ride a horse? he thought to himself. There was a lot of trouble that a good rider could cause out here, since they were miles away from other people. But maybe there would be even more trouble for someone who didn't know anything about horses and wanted to get away from his father."}

Although climbing high mountains remains extremely dangerous because of freezing temperatures and severe storms, the world's most experienced climbers are now looking for new challenges to test their skills. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria developed her passion for mountain climbing when she was a teenager. After she completed her education, she found work as a nurse, however she kept climbing mountains during her free time because this activity had become so important to her."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified": "After she had climbed Everest, Gerlinde decided that she would climb all fourteen of the world's highest mountains. These mountains are all more than 8,000 metres high, which makes them extremely dangerous. However, she wanted to make her challenge even more difficult, so Gerlinde always climbs without using oxygen tanks. This is very risky because there isn't enough oxygen at the top of such high mountains. When climbers don't get sufficient oxygen, their brain and body cannot function properly, and they might even die. Since Gerlinde has become famous as a mountain climber, she uses this reputation to help a charity organization. This charity supports poor children and children without parents in Nepal, although the work is challenging because these communities need so much help."}

Scientists are not sure how the dogs know when they should get off the train. One idea is that they use their very good sense of smell and have learned to remember the smells of places where they like to go. Another possibility is that they have learned to understand the names of train stations that they hear when announcements are made. However it works, people who travel on the underground trains have become so used to seeing dogs on the trains that most local people don't really notice them anymore."}

He began his incredible journey next to a small mountain stream in the Andes of Peru. After spending two years and four months walking through difficult conditions, he finally reached the place where the mighty river meets the Atlantic Ocean in Brazil. During this amazing adventure, he had covered approximately 6,000 kilometres on foot.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest is known as the home of extremely dangerous wildlife, including deadly snakes that could kill a person, aggressive crocodiles and powerful jaguars. Because of these threats, Ed was constantly facing serious danger throughout his journey. However, he was fortunate enough to survive this challenging expedition, even though he encountered many frightening situations. While he managed to avoid the most serious dangers, the worst problems he actually experienced were receiving thousands of painful bites from mosquitoes and ants, which made his daily progress very uncomfortable."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In Britain, the average person spends more than £1,000 on new clothes every year. This is around four per cent of the money they earn. That might not sound like a lot, however this number shows two problems that are much more serious for society and for the environment.\n\nFirst, people buy a lot of these clothes with credit cards. British people now owe about £670 per adult to credit card companies. That's 66 per cent of the average money that people spend on clothes. Also, people are not only spending money they don't have, but they're also using it to buy things they don't really need.\n\nBritain throws away 300,000 tons of clothing every year. Most of these clothes are put into landfill sites, which means they are buried in the ground as waste. This has become a big problem because people buy too many clothes and then get rid of them quickly."}

{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "One of the most important jobs that modern zoos do today is helping with international breeding programmes, especially for animals that might disappear forever. In the wild, some of the rarest animals have problems finding partners to have babies with, and they could also be in danger from hunters, loss of their homes and other animals that hunt them. A good zoo will help these species to live and have babies in a safe place. Also, when the numbers of some wild animals become smaller, there is more danger that groups of animals become too similar to each other. Breeding programmes give us protection against this problem: animals that have been born in zoos can be put back into the wild so that animal groups stay different from each other."}

With trains, it is how fast they hit the bridge that can make it collapse. With boats, it is because they are very heavy that can cause the bridge to fall down, even if they are moving slowly when this happens. The best way to stop bridge problems is to prepare for them. New technology that can find weak parts in bridges, safer places for workers and better bridge designs can all help to reduce these terrible accidents."}

One by one, the frightened animals in the small lifeboat attack and kill each other until only Pi and the large tiger have survived this terrible situation. Fortunately for Pi, the tiger has already been given the human name Richard Parker by zoo workers, and this powerful tiger feels very seasick from the rough ocean waves.

They have taken many of the remaining animals with them on the long ship journey. While they are traveling across the ocean, there is a terrible storm and the ship goes down into the deep sea. Sadly, Pi's family and all the sailors on the ship drown in the dark water, but Pi manages to get into a small lifeboat that was floating nearby.

Even more impressive is that it became the first young adult novel that has managed to sell over one million electronic copies, which was a major success in the digital book market.\n\nHollywood producers decided to turn The Hunger Games into a major film, and the movie has been just as successful as the original book. During its opening weekend in North America alone, the film earned an incredible 152.5 million dollars, which proves how much audiences were excited to see this story on the big screen. This amazing success demonstrates that both the book and movie have captured people's imagination in a powerful way."}
{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified": "Maybe dreams happen because our mind connects the thoughts we have experienced during the day, although these thoughts appear in dreams with different meanings than we might expect. When we are awake, our thoughts usually come to our minds as words, which is similar to conversations we have with ourselves inside our head. However, when we are asleep, the part of our brain that controls language becomes less active, while the part that controls our emotions and feelings becomes much more active than usual. This could explain why dreams often feel so strange and emotional, even though they might be based on normal things that happened to us during the day. Since our language skills are not working properly while we sleep, our brain has to express these daily experiences through pictures and feelings instead of clear words."}

This is called 'self-disclosure', which means sharing your private thoughts with someone you trust. Just one person is enough for these deep conversations, although you should also have other relationships too. It's not enough to have many friends who you only do activities with or chat to about things like music or football. That deeper connection with someone is the most important thing.\n\nSome people might need to learn how to listen well to others. This skill could help them build stronger relationships with the people around them."}

For example, they might say 'You are really good at seeing details' or 'You have a real talent for organizing events'. However, research has shown that this way might not help people improve their abilities.\n\nInstead, we should focus on how people do things. We should praise their effort and their willingness to try new things. We should also praise the ways they solve problems. When we do this, we help people develop new skills better. We can also help them continue to get better at the talents they already have. This method works much better than just praising someone's natural ability. This is because it makes people want to keep trying, even when things become difficult."}

This molecule is methane, which is an important part of natural gas. Methane has one special feature - it can only stay in the air for a few hundred years before it disappears. This means that something on Mars must be making new methane all the time to replace what has gone away. NASA scientists have found that Mars sends out thousands of tons of methane at once. The amount of methane goes up and down during different seasons of the year, almost like the planet is breathing the gas in and out."}

She gave them problems that were a bit too difficult for them to solve. One group of children had a positive reaction to this challenge. They said they loved trying hard things because they understood that they could get better at things if they practiced. Dweck says these children had a 'growth mindset', which means they focus on what they might be able to do in the future if they keep trying.\n\nHowever, the other group of children felt very different about the test. They thought Dweck was testing how smart they were, and they believed they had failed. These children had what Dweck calls a 'fixed mindset', which means they could not imagine that they would ever get better at these problems. Some of these children even said they might cheat on tests in the future. Others started looking for children who had done worse than them so they could feel better about themselves."}

This might be an old hospital that people have left, a frightening empty house, or a town where no one lives now. There's something special about lonely, empty places that makes us feel strange. What was life like when people used to live there? Why did they decide to go away? Maybe it's also because these places are so quiet, which can make us feel very scared too. Of course, empty places are also useful for horror film makers because it seems more real that your phone won't work there either."}

He managed to identify 190 people from the videos. He could often recognize people just by looking at their eyes, which was quite amazing. His help was very important for the police investigation because he was so good at this work.\n\nThe police had 200,000 hours of video recordings from the riots. However, even though they used special computer software that should recognize faces, it could only identify one person.

Today, there are still civil wars in some places, but most countries are living together more peacefully than they did before. \n\nHowever, terrorism has increased a lot in recent years. Also, since World War II ended, wars have killed many more ordinary people than soldiers. Even so, the numbers about ordinary people are not all bad news. Although people are nine times more likely to die because of violent crime than because of political fighting, the number of murders around the world has gone down.

She wanted to change how people think about women in her country.

Additionally, six million fewer children die each year because of diseases. Millions more girls have gained access to education now, and millions of people have been able to get clean drinking water. This demonstrates that life has improved significantly for many people, although most of us are not aware of these positive developments.\n\nThese improvements have happened because governments and organizations have been working together to solve problems.

The next step will be robots that can work completely alone. These 'killer robots' would follow orders, but they would decide who to kill by themselves.

Their most important banana variety, which was called the Gros Michel banana, was dying from disease. People also called it Big Mike because of its large size. Now the same dangerous situation is happening again to the banana that replaced Big Mike - the Cavendish banana that we eat today.\n\nThe Gros Michel banana had been perfect for international business because it had thick skin that protected it well. This meant it could travel long distances to different countries without getting damaged during transport. It also tasted very sweet and had a strong banana flavor, which customers around the world loved. Because of these excellent qualities, this type of banana had been grown on almost every banana farm across Central America's plantations.\n\nUnited Fruit was the biggest banana company in South America at that time, and they controlled most of the banana trade. They wanted to produce as many bananas as possible while keeping their costs as low as they could. So they used a special farming method that seemed very smart - they didn't grow new banana plants from seeds like most other crops. Instead, they took small shoots from the stems of existing healthy plants and grew new plants from these shoots. This process is called cloning, and it creates plants that are exactly the same. They also planted all these banana plants very close together in their fields so they could grow more bananas in smaller areas and make more money."}

Australia has a dangerous spider called the Sydney funnel-web spider, but no one has died from its bite since doctors made special medicine in 1981. However, you should be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas because you don't want to make them angry.

However, there are very few physical signs that can help us with this question. The objects that our early family members left behind don't tell us what kind of speech they could make.\n\nOne thing we can see in the bones of early humans is how the mouth, throat and tongue changed over time. Scientists have found that by about 100,000 years ago, humans had developed the ability to make complex sounds. Before that time, scientists who study how humans developed can only guess about this.

What is more, many people wrongly think that scientists are strange people who have poor social skills or that their work is lonely and separate from the rest of the world. These are false ideas that the media shows us, but they might mean that girls do not connect with scientists. Because of this, girls see science as a career path that does not interest them.

Although the paper is free, some students find it difficult to get copies since they must visit the university buildings to pick them up. There is also an environmental concern that has worried many people. Even though thousands of copies are distributed, many become waste that students leave around the campus, which creates litter problems everywhere and damages the university's appearance."}
{"text_id": "118-b1", "simplified": "At Girox Foods, we have been facing a serious problem with workers leaving their jobs. Every year, about 12 per cent of our employees decide to leave the company, which has become quite worrying. Although this might not seem like a major issue, other companies in our industry only lose seven per cent of their workers each year. Since our numbers are much higher than average, we need to take action quickly.\n\nThe main goal of this report is to discover why employees are not satisfied at work. We want to understand what makes workers choose to stay or leave our company. Even though some people might think money is the only reason, there could be other important factors that we haven't considered yet. After we have identified the real reasons behind this problem, we will suggest practical ideas about how to improve the workplace environment.\n\nIf we can successfully make these changes, more employees would want to stay with the company for a longer time. However, we must act soon because losing experienced workers costs us money and affects our business performance."}

I don't think this is such a big problem for my generation because we have lived without technology for so long. We know how to be alone and, more importantly, we know that it's OK to be alone. However, people under 20 are completely different. They are so busy sending messages to each other that they never experience the feeling of being alone. Because of this, they might not learn how to enjoy spending time by themselves. Also, they are learning how to talk through messages that can be changed and corrected. This means they are not learning the skill of real conversation that happens immediately with the person who is standing in front of you."}

When positive and negative comments always come at the same time, people might not value the good things you say. They could start to ignore the positive words because they expect bad news to follow. You should make sure there are times when you only give positive feedback. This means you tell someone they have done well without adding any criticism. You might feel like you want to help them improve by pointing out problems, but you should resist this feeling sometimes. If you always mix good and bad feedback together, the good feedback won't have the same effect on people."}
