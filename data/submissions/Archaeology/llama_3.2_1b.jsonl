The constant storms and extreme heat also test their endurance. However, they manage to stay alive. Sometimes, Pi feels happy about his three religions, but other times he feels lonely and overwhelmed. Eventually, they see the Mexican coast on the horizon, which brings new hope. You should read the book to discover what happens next."}

Many people felt anxious on his first day, just like anyone else starts at a new school. They didn't want to sit next to him, and some kids stared at him or whispered about him behind their hands. Fortunately, he made friends with Jack and Summer, who became his classmates. However, things quickly became challenging. His classmates were concerned about getting sick, so they avoided touching him. This made everything more difficult. Auggie experienced both good and bad times during the school year, but sadly, a severe accident at a school camp changed everything."}

However, being bored and disobedient is not enough to escape by walking. Sam looked at the biggest horse and kicked at the ground with its strong hooves. He thought, \"Can I really ride?\" He had heard stories about problems that riders could get into when they didn't know much about horses. Maybe he should be careful."}

Despite this, some experienced climbers continue to look for new challenges. For example, Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria began climbing when she was a teenager. After completing her education, she worked as a nurse, but kept climbing in her free time."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified": "Gerlinde has been climbing Everest many times before. She wants to climb all fourteen highest mountains above 8,000 metres worldwide. Climbing without oxygen tanks is more difficult than usual. It's also a risk because low air pressure at high altitudes can affect how our brains and bodies work. Gerlinde uses her fame as a climber to help a charity that supports children and orphans in Nepal."}
{"text_id": "76-b1", "simplified": "We often think about what we've bought over the years, and it's easy to see that not everything we own is being used properly. For example, we might buy a new coat that looks nice, but we don't wear it much because we live in a warm climate. We might also keep our old phone, which we haven't used in a while, or store our car in a garage that we only use occasionally. Even our guest room in the house has become a storage space."}

{"text_id": "80-b1", "simplified": "Dogs living in groups often look out for each other. This means that small, cute dogs are frequently taken out to ask for food, which helps the whole group. Some dogs have also been seen using the city's public transport system to get around. However, scientists still don't fully understand why these dogs know when to stop at a particular station. One theory is that they use their excellent sense of smell to find familiar places, like the train tracks where they usually go. Another possible reason is that they've learned to recognize the names of stations they hear in announcements. As a result, people who ride the metro are now used to seeing dogs on the trains almost everywhere."}

He began his journey in a small stream in the Andes mountains of Peru and ended at the river's mouth in Brazil two years and four months later. His trip covered a distance of 6,000 kilometres. The Amazon rainforest is a challenging place with many dangers, including snakes, crocodiles, and big cats. Fortunately, Ed managed to escape with only a few minor injuries."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In Britain, people spend over £1,000 on new clothes each year. This is about four per cent of their total income. However, this amount hides two significant issues for society and the environment. Firstly, many of this money is spent on credit cards. In the UK, individuals owe roughly £670 per adult to banks that lend them money. This debt accounts for almost half of their average annual expenditure on clothes. Secondly, people are using their own money to buy things they don't really need. The country throws away around 300,000 tons of clothes each year. Most of this waste ends up in landfills."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified": "Ed's journey was challenging due to lack of technology. He relied on a radio to find food and get permission to cross someone else's land. Many locals joined him and helped him navigate the difficult terrain. While walking, Ed wrote a blog about his daily life, which he thought would be interesting for others. He also used the news about his trip to talk about the problem of deforestation in Brazil and Peru, and to raise money for environmental and children's causes."}
{"text_id": "84-b1", "simplified": "Many businesses now understand how well the sharing economy works and want to make money by using resources that others don't use. They create websites where people can find roommates or housemates who will help them pay the rent. For instance, Airbnb connects people who need a place to live with those who have extra space. This way, both parties get something useful out of it. Other examples include Uber, which lets people use their own cars as taxi services to earn extra money at home."}
{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "Zoos play a big role in helping countries work together to protect endangered species. However, many wild animals have trouble finding a partner and having children in their natural homes because of problems like poaching and losing their homes. A good zoo provides a safe place for these animals to live and breed. This helps stop some species from disappearing forever. By releasing animals raised in zoos back into the wild, we can keep different species from becoming too dominant."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified": "Boats and trains can cause bridges to collapse in different ways. However, boats are more likely to do this because they are much heavier than trains, which can make them fall over quickly, even if they move slowly. This is why it's essential to think carefully before crossing a bridge. To prevent accidents, we need modern technology that can check for weaknesses in bridges, safer working conditions, and better designs. All these measures can help reduce the number of tragic events like this."}
{"text_id": "87-b1", "simplified": "Pi begins by being scared of animals and decides to stay in the water. However, he quickly realizes that there are hungry sharks nearby and decides to return to the lifeboat. As the animals in the lifeboat start to argue with each other, Pi gets out too. Eventually, only Pi and a tiger named Richard Parker remain. Luckily, Richard Parker isn't interested in eating Pi because he knows it will make him very ill."}
{"text_id": "88-b1", "simplified": "\"When Pi was 16, he decided to leave home because his parents didn't agree with him. They wanted him to stay at the zoo and work instead. But some animals were sold to other zoos in North America, and Pi's family had to travel by ship to Canada. Unfortunately, a big storm hit during their journey, and the ship sank. Everyone on board, including Pi's family and the sailors, died, but Pi was left alone in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orang-utan, and a huge tiger.\""}

{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified": "We often think about what's happening inside us when we're sleeping, but these thoughts take on special meanings in our dreams. When we're awake, our minds just store our thoughts as words, like the conversations we have with ourselves. However, when we're asleep, a different part of our brain takes control of language, making it more active, which is why we dream. \n\nThis is because the part of our brain that helps us understand emotions is not as strong when we're asleep, so our dreams often reflect how we feel."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "Having good relationships is very important for happiness. Many people find that they have close friendships and family relationships, which they make time to spend with regularly. It's also helpful to talk to someone about your feelings, known as self-disclosure. Just talking to one person can be beneficial, especially when you're part of a group of friends and family. This deeper connection is crucial for building strong relationships. However, some people may struggle to understand how to listen to others effectively, which can make it harder to develop closer relationships."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Carol Dweck, a psychologist, thinks that our brains can get better at certain things. She says that praising people who do something well, like 'You pay attention' or 'You organize events', can help us learn and improve. However, research suggests that thanking people for their work and trying different methods can also be helpful."}
{"text_id": "93-b1", "simplified": "The rover looks at the air around it every day. In 2014, it found a type of gas called methane. Methane is helpful for making natural gas. However, it doesn't stay on Mars for very long. This means there must be a place where methane is produced. Scientists believe Mars produces a lot of methane each year. The levels of methane go up and down depending on the season, maybe because the planet gets new methane at certain times of the year."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified": "\"When Carol Dweck started working with kids at Stanford University, she gave them some tasks that were a bit too difficult for them. Some of the children enjoyed the challenge and thought they could improve by using their abilities. This made them believe that they could learn new things.

{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified": "People often prefer staying in areas with fewer people living there, such as old hospitals or deserted houses. This is partly because these places feel more isolated and lonely. When people moved out, they left their homes because the area was quiet and peaceful, which made it easier for them to start fresh somewhere new. They were also looking for a place where they could feel safe and at ease. \n\nHowever, abandoned places can also be useful for horror movie makers. It's more likely that you won't find anyone around when you visit these areas, which makes it seem more believable that you'll encounter problems."}

He quickly noticed some people and decided to stop his holiday to assist with the identification process. After spending six months looking through the CCTV footage, he was able to identify 190 people, including many from their faces. This helped a lot in the investigation. It's surprising that facial recognition technology couldn't find a single person out of 200,000 hours of footage, which is a lot."}

{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "The speaker's talk was really interesting and made some good points. One thing they talked about was how our parents' actions can affect us. For example, when parents post on social media while cooking dinner or waiting at a traffic light, it can make teenagers want to text while doing their homework. This is because people often want to be in many places at once. So, they switch between their real life and what's happening online. I've seen this happen with my own teenager and her friends. They plan to meet and then spend time talking to each other online."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "News stories about violence make us think the world is getting worse. There were 30 wars between 1945 and 1990 that resulted in over 100,000 deaths. Now, there are still civil wars, but countries are generally living more safely than they were in the past. Unfortunately, terrorism has increased in recent years, and since World War II, many more civilians have been killed than soldiers. For civilians, things aren't all bad - deaths are almost nine times more likely to be caused by violent crime than by politics. The global number of murders decreased slightly between 2000 and 2015."}

{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "Most people think that poor countries are in a difficult situation: they struggle with extreme poverty, ruled by leaders who don't make decisions fairly, and have limited opportunities for change. However, this isn't entirely accurate. In reality, many positive changes are happening. Over the last 20 years, over 700 million people have gained more money and left poverty behind. This has also led to a decrease in child mortality rates, as well as more girls being able to go to school and having access to clean drinking water."}

For example, the song Glory Days is about people in a small town reflecting on their past when they were young and successful. Another song, Downbound Train, is about a young man whose life is changed when he loses his job.

There aren't many physical clues; old tools don't show us what early humans could say. However, we can see changes in the human face and body over time. For example, around 100,000 years ago, people started making different sounds with their mouths, throats, and tongues. These early sounds helped humans communicate better. Before that, scientists couldn't be sure if early humans talked to each other in a similar way."}
