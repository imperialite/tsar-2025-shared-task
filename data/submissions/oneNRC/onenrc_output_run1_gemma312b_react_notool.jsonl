This is called the sharing economy."}

But it\u2019s still good to have dreams where you can learn about what you are thinking!"}

The number of murders has gone down a little. In 2000, there were about 8 murders per 100,000 people. In 2015, there were about 5.3."}

She wants to change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing when she was helping people in Tibet and Nepal. Most people in Bangladesh have never seen a mountain. Many people in Bangladesh are now paying attention to her work, and people around the world are noticing too."}

But this is not really true. Things are changing. In the last 20 years, over 700 million people have made more money and are not poor anymore. Also, 6 million fewer children die each year from sickness. Many more girls go to school, and many people have clean water."}

The songs tell stories about regular people who work hard. They feel sad because they don't have a good life. One song is about people remembering when they were young. Another song is about a man who loses his job. The singer seems to know these people and their lives. The album shows how talented the singer is."}

A company called United Fruit grew a lot of these bananas. They didn't grow them from seeds. They took parts from the banana plants and grew new plants that were the same. This was the easiest way to grow bananas."}

My generation is okay because we lived without technology before. We know how to be alone, and it\u2019s good to be alone. But young people under 20 are different. They talk to each other a lot, but they don't feel quiet or alone. They might not learn to like being by themselves. Also, they learn to talk by sending messages. They can change the messages. They don't learn to talk to people in person, right now."}

{"text_id": "27-b1", "simplified": "In the 1990s, graffiti still existed, but there was also a lot more street art happening worldwide. Some artists wanted to share political messages and created art to make people think about problems like war, unfairness, and treating people differently. Other street artists mainly wanted to create pretty and pleasing artwork. In South America, many street artists worked in poor areas, adding colour, happiness, and beauty to dull city walls."}

In this story, the city of Athens was controlled by Crete. The people of Athens fought back. As punishment, the king of Crete, Minos, made the Athenians send seven boys and seven girls to Crete each year. These young people were put in a maze and eaten by a monster called the Minotaur. But Theseus fought and killed the Minotaur. Suzanne thinks of Katniss Everdeen as a modern-day Theseus."}

This idea began in Canada in the 1990s and then became popular in the United States. It\u2019s a way of saying \u2018no\u2019 to spending too much money, especially during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. On Buy Nothing Day, people protest and sometimes even cut up their credit cards. Throughout the year, groups of people share and fix things they already have."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or vandalism? It depends on what you think.

{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "Many people in the art world now see graffiti and street art as a valuable form of art. There have been large shows of street art in art galleries in cities like Paris, London and Los Angeles. In 2008, the American artist Elura Emerald showed street art in a New York gallery. She said that street artists are just showing their feelings and not causing harm. She thinks they deserve to be admired and praised."}
{"text_id": "36-b1", "simplified": "After the age of ten, most people have four to six dreams each night. This means they could have around 2,000 dreams a year. So, by the time someone is 80 years old, they may have had about 140,000 dreams. Even though people often forget 95 to 99 percent of their dreams, they still remember a few thousand during their lives. It\u2019s easy to imagine that sometimes, a dream will be similar to something that really happens, especially if the dream is about things that happen often."}

Because of this, many people in the city don\u2019t want them there."}

This allows people to share things directly with each other. This is called the sharing economy."}
{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams became common. One idea was that dreams show things our minds don't usually think about. Freud thought that understanding our dreams could help us understand our hidden feelings and solve problems. However, another idea said that dreams are just random brain activity while the brain sorts through memories. When we wake up, we try to find meaning in these images and feelings and create a story."}

At first, they didn't buy electrical items, clothes, or things for their home. Then, they stopped paying for services like haircuts, meals at restaurants, or petrol for their cars. After a year, they saved $55,000."}

{"text_id": "49-b1", "simplified": "Some people believe writing down your dreams can help you have lucid dreams. Lucid dreams are when you know you are dreaming and can control what happens. For example, you could change a bad dream into a good one, or guide your dream like a film director. This means you\u2019re not just understanding your dreams, you\u2019re creating them. It\u2019s still a good idea to have some dreams where your mind can show you what it\u2019s thinking about!"}

But charity shops cannot sell all of these clothes. Cheap, trendy clothes quickly go out of style and are often not good enough to recycle. People don't want to buy them used. A lot of clothes are thrown away. Charities send clothes they cannot sell to other countries. This causes more problems for those countries and harms the environment."}

She has climbed the highest mountains in the world, cycled across Canada, and run a very long race in the Sahara Desert, where it was very hot. One of her most incredible trips was skiing to the South Pole. On her first day, she fell into a large block of ice and needed help. Many people would have stopped there, but Meagan continued. She reached the South Pole forty days later. She pulled a sled with her tent and food behind her through very cold weather and snowstorms."}

Because of how he looks, it was a very painful experience. No one wanted to sit with him, and he noticed other children looking at him and talking about him. Luckily, he made friends with Jack and Summer. But the school year wasn't easy. Auggie learned that some students were scared to touch him. He had many good and bad times during the year. Finally, a surprising and upsetting event at a school trip changed everything."}
{"text_id": "73-b1", "simplified": "The two men looked towards the north side of the land. It went on and on, as far as they could see. Even the fences were hard to see from where they were. No matter how bored or disobedient a young boy felt, he couldn\u2019t run away. Sam watched the largest horse, which stamped its big feet on the ground. Could the boy ride it? he thought. A good rider could cause a lot of problems out here, so far from anyone. But perhaps someone who didn't know anything about horses would have even bigger problems, trying to leave his father."}
{"text_id": "74-b1", "simplified": "More than 4,000 people, between the ages of 13 and 80, have climbed to the top of Mount Everest. Climbing very high mountains in cold weather and strong storms is still very risky, but the best climbers now want new challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria started to enjoy mountain climbing when she was a teenager. After she finished school, she worked as a nurse, but she also continued to climb mountains in her spare time."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified": "After climbing Mount Everest, Gerlinde wanted to climb all fourteen of the world\u2019s mountains that are over 8,000 metres high. To make it more difficult, she climbs without using oxygen. This is dangerous because the lack of oxygen at the top of tall mountains can harm your brain and body. Gerlinde uses her popularity as a climber to help a charity that supports children and orphans in Nepal."}
{"text_id": "76-b1", "simplified": "Think about the things we\u2019ve bought. We can probably see that we don\u2019t use everything we own. For example, maybe we have a warm coat even though we live in a hot country. Or perhaps we have an old phone that we don\u2019t use anymore because we bought a newer one. Sometimes we buy things like cars that we only use occasionally, or even turn a spare room into a storage space."}
{"text_id": "77-b1", "simplified": "People have believed for a long time that dreams can predict the future. They thought dreams were important messages, giving us information or understanding. Many people remember dreaming about something, like a place or person, and then it actually happened later."}
{"text_id": "78-b1", "simplified": "Many large and costly construction projects around the world involve building bridges. Bridges are important connections that allow cars, trucks, and trains to travel across water, mountains, or other roads. Because of their importance, bridges are a key part of civil engineering and are carefully checked, particularly if they fail."}
{"text_id": "79-b1", "simplified": "Gabriela was having problems with her team, so she wrote an email to her manager from Sweden.

{"text_id": "80-b1", "simplified": "Dogs that live together have learned that people are more likely to give food to smaller, more attractive dogs. So, these dogs go to beg for food for the whole group. Some dogs have even learned to use the city\u2019s train system to travel around their area! Scientists don\u2019t know how the dogs know when to get off the train. They think the dogs might use their good sense of smell to find places they like. Or, they might learn to understand the names of the train stops. Either way, people who use the trains are now used to seeing dogs and they usually don\u2019t notice them."}
{"text_id": "81-b1", "simplified": "Ed Stafford, from the UK, was the first person to walk the whole way along the Amazon River. He began near a small river in the Andes mountains of Peru. He finished at the river's end in Brazil, after two years and four months. He walked 6,000 kilometers. The Amazon rainforest has dangerous animals like poisonous snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars, so Ed was often in danger. He was very lucky to survive, and he only suffered from many mosquito and ant bites."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In the UK, people spend over \u00a31,000 on new clothes each year. This is about 4% of what they earn. It may not seem like a lot, but there are some problems with this. Many people use credit cards to buy clothes. People in the UK owe about \u00a3670 to credit card companies, which is almost the money they spend on clothes. People are spending money they don't have, and buying things they don't really need. The UK throws away 300,000 tons of clothes every year, and most of it ends up in landfills."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified": "Ed couldn\u2019t have walked without technology. He used a radio to ask people in the rainforest for food and to ask if he could cross their land. Many people came to see him and helped him walk through the hardest parts of the land. While he was walking, Ed wrote a blog about what he did each day. He used the news about his trip to talk about the damage to the rainforest and to collect money for groups that help the environment and children in Brazil and Peru."}
{"text_id": "84-b1", "simplified": "Many businesses now see that the sharing economy can make them money, and they want to use things that are not being used much. A common business idea is for companies to create websites that connect people who need something with people who can provide it. For example, Airbnb helps people rent out rooms or houses they don\u2019t need all the time to make money. Uber is another example; it lets people use their own cars to give rides and earn extra money."}
{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "Zoos today are very important for helping endangered animals. Sometimes, rare animals in the wild have trouble finding partners and having babies. They can also be in danger from people hunting them, losing their homes, or being attacked by other animals. Good zoos give these animals a safe place to live and breed. Also, when the number of wild animals decreases, they can become too alike. Breeding programmes help with this: animals born in zoos can be released into the wild to make the animal population more varied."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified": "These accidents are very uncommon. Trains and boats can both damage bridges, but in different ways. Trains can damage a bridge because of how fast they are going. Boats can damage a bridge because they are very heavy, even if they are moving slowly. To prevent bridge damage, it is important to plan ahead. New technologies that find problems with the bridge's structure, safer work conditions, and improved designs can all help reduce these accidents."}
{"text_id": "87-b1", "simplified": "Pi was scared of the animals and jumped into the sea. Then he remembered there were sharks in the water and had to climb back into the lifeboat. The animals in the lifeboat started to kill and eat each other until only Pi and a tiger were left. Luckily, the tiger, who Pi called Richard Parker, felt sick and didn\u2019t want to eat him."}
{"text_id": "88-b1", "simplified": "When Pi is sixteen years old, a new government is chosen that his parents disagree with. They are worried about what will happen, so Pi\u2019s parents decide to close the zoo and move to Canada. They sell some of the animals to other zoos in North America. The family travels to Canada by ship, taking some of the animals with them. During the journey, there is a very bad storm and the ship sinks. Sadly, Pi\u2019s family and the sailors all die, but Pi survives and is in a small boat with a hyena, zebra, orangutan and a large tiger."}
{"text_id": "89-b1", "simplified": "The Hunger Games is a very popular book for teenagers and young people, written by the American Suzanne Collins. It was published in 2008 and has been translated into many languages. It has sold millions of copies worldwide. It was also the first book for children to sell over a million copies online. Now, it\u2019s a big film and is very successful too. It earned a lot of money, over 150 million dollars, in its first weekend in North America."}
{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified": "Dreams might happen because our brains try to sort out our thoughts from the day. But in dreams, these thoughts often have a special meaning. When we are awake, we usually think in words, like we are talking to ourselves. But when we sleep, the part of our brain that uses language is less busy, while the part that controls feelings becomes more active."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "Being happy often means having good relationships with others. A study showed that people who are happy usually have close relationships with their friends and family, and they spend time with them often. It\u2019s also important to have at least one person you can talk to about your feelings \u2013 this is called 'sharing'. Just one close friend is enough, along with other friends too. It's not enough to just have friends to do things with or talk about hobbies. A stronger, more personal connection is very important. Sometimes, people need to learn how to listen better to build better relationships."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Psychologist Carol Dweck believes our brains can change and we can learn new skills, even if we weren\u2019t good at them before. Often, we praise people for their results or what seems like natural talent, for example, saying \u2018You\u2019re good at noticing details\u2019 or \u2018You're good at planning events\u2019. But studies show that praising effort, trying new things, and how people solve problems can help them learn new skills and improve existing ones."}
{"text_id": "93-b1", "simplified": "The rover checks the air around it regularly. In 2014, it found methane in the air. Methane is a simple organic molecule and a key part of natural gas. It doesn\u2019t last long \u2013 only a few hundred years. This means something on Mars is creating more methane. NASA says Mars releases a lot of methane \u2013 thousands of tons at once. The amount of methane changes with the seasons, almost like the planet is breathing."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified": "Carol Dweck, a psychologist from Stanford University, gave difficult problems to a group of ten-year-old children. Some children liked the challenge and believed they could get better. Carol Dweck called this a \u2018growth mindset\u2019 \u2013 thinking about what they could do. Other children felt they had failed and thought their intelligence wasn't good enough. This is called a \u2018fixed mindset\u2019 \u2013 finding it hard to improve. Some of these children said they might cheat, and others tried to feel better by comparing themselves to those who were doing worse."}
{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified": "Horror films often use places where nobody lives. This could be an old, empty hospital, a frightening house, or a town with no people. These lonely places make us wonder \u2013 what was it like when people lived there? Why did they go? It\u2019s also scary because they are so quiet. It\u2019s easy for film directors to use these places too, because it seems believable that you wouldn't have a phone signal there."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified": "In scary movies, basements are often frightening places. They are usually dark and damp, and you reach them by a small staircase. Sometimes, something is hiding there, or a bad person might have hidden things. Basements can feel creepy even when nothing is actually there."}
{"text_id": "97-b1", "simplified": "Gary Collins was a policeman who wasn't working when he watched the riots in London on TV. He knew some of the people involved, so he stopped his holiday to help find them. He spent six months looking at CCTV videos and identified 190 people, often just by looking at their eyes. His help was very important for the police investigation. Even with special computer programs, the police only found one person from 200,000 hours of video."}
{"text_id": "98-b1", "simplified": "I find it really interesting to think about how we can make our bodies develop faster. What if we could put a computer in our brain? Soon, we might be able to do this and improve things like our ability to do math, see and hear better, and remember things more easily. I think this will become more common in the future."}
{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "The talk was very interesting, and the speaker was right about some things. For example, parents influence their children. It's hard to stop teenagers from texting while doing homework when they see their parents using social media while cooking or waiting in the car. She also said that people often want to do many things at the same time. So, they talk to people in person and online. I see this a lot with my daughter and her friends. They plan to meet, but then they sit together and talk on their phones instead."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "Some news makes us think the world is more violent, but there\u2019s also reason to be hopeful. From the end of World War II until 1990, there were many wars that killed a lot of people. Now, countries are generally living more peacefully than before, even though there are still wars. However, terrorism has increased recently, and wars have killed more people who are not soldiers. But, the situation isn\u2019t completely negative. People are more likely to die from crime than from wars. Also, the number of murders worldwide has decreased slightly, from 8 people per 100,000 in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}

However, these projects often stop, and the women are left with nothing. Wasfia thought Bangladesh needed to do more to support itself. So, she combined her love of climbing mountains with her work for human rights to try and change how people think about women. She started climbing when she worked on projects in Tibet and Nepal. This is because Bangladesh is mostly flat and people rarely see mountains. Her campaign is getting attention from people in Bangladesh and around the world."}
{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "Many people think that developing countries are in a bad situation: with lots of poverty, ruled by dictators, and with not much hope for improvement. But this is not completely true. Things are actually changing. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have earned more money and escaped poverty. Also, 6 million fewer children die each year because of sickness. More girls are going to school, and millions of people now have clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "Many managers try to make feedback more positive by putting negative comments between good ones. But, if this happens often, employees might think the positive comments are just to hide the negative ones, and they won't be as helpful. Instead, positive feedback should encourage good work, not just soften criticism."}
{"text_id": "104-b1", "simplified": "I support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. Don\u2019t think of scary robots from movies. Instead, think about what\u2019s happening now. Military machines like drones and robots are already being used to kill, with not much help from people. Soon, there might be robots that can make their own decisions about who to kill. I believe this would be wrong and dangerous for everyone. We need to be careful about what we tell machines to do."}
{"text_id": "105-b1", "simplified": "More people learn English than learn any other language. English is also spoken in many countries. However, more people speak Chinese as their first language than speak any other language. The number of people who speak a language as their first language doesn't seem to be connected to how many people learn it. But there is a connection between how many people learn a language and how many countries where it\u2019s spoken."}
{"text_id": "106-b1", "simplified": "Your manager wants to talk to you about your work on the recent project. You feel worried about this all weekend, thinking about what you might have done wrong. On Monday morning, you go to her office. She starts by saying you did a good job, and you wonder if she's just being polite before giving you criticism. You know that sometimes people give compliments first, then tell you what you need to improve, and then give another compliment."}
{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "Born in the USA is a lively and energetic rock album. However, the songs also have strong feelings. The music is catchy, but it tells stories about difficult times for some people in America. Many songs are about people who work hard but don\u2019t have a good life. They feel sad and angry. For example, Glory Days is about people remembering when they were young and had hope. The song Downbound Train tells a story about a young man who loses his job and his life becomes difficult. It seems the singer is writing about real people and how things could have been different. This album shows you how talented the singer is."}

Lewis has seen these problems himself. He has seen coral reefs that have lost their color because the water is too warm. He has also seen areas under the sea where there are no plants or animals, and lots of plastic. Lewis believes nature can get better if we let it. But we need to act quickly. If we don\u2019t take care of the oceans, we might have a very big problem that we can\u2019t fix."}

In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at how humans have progressed and finds positive results. We are living longer, healthier, more free, and happier lives. Pinker believes the problem is that the ideas of reason and science are now being challenged. When people talk in ways that encourage division, hopelessness, and a lack of trust, it can harm important things like democracy and working together around the world."}
{"text_id": "111-b1", "simplified": "In old horror movies, it was hard for characters to get help because they couldn\u2019t call for help or the police. Now, with cell phones, this is less believable. To keep the suspense, writers make sure there\u2019s no cell phone signal! If you\u2019re a hero in a scary movie, you probably won\u2019t have any signal when you really need to call for help. Or your phone battery will run out just as you\u2019re making the call. Sometimes, both things happen."}
{"text_id": "112-b1", "simplified": "In the 1950s, companies that grew bananas for business in Central America had a problem. Their most profitable banana, called Gros Michel (or Big Mike), was dying. Now, the same thing is happening to Cavendish, which replaced Big Mike. Gros Michel bananas were easy to transport, had thick skins, and tasted good. They grew everywhere in Central America. United Fruit Company, the biggest grower and exporter at the time, grew bananas very efficiently. They didn\u2019t grow new plants from seeds. Instead, they took shoots from existing plants and grew them close together in fields."}

Spider bites can be painful, but they are usually not life-threatening. The Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia hasn't killed anyone since we created an antidote in 1981. Be careful not to upset hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they feel scared, they will spray irritating hairs that can get into your skin or eyes."}
{"text_id": "114-b1", "simplified": "This common idea was liked in many horror movies from the late 1900s. The movie starts with a group of young people having fun, but it ends with almost everyone dying except one girl. At the beginning, this girl is often quiet, nervous, and not very brave. But by the end, she becomes the strongest and most clever person. The last girl usually survives."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "To understand how humans developed the ability to use complicated language, we need to study what makes our brains different from those of other animals. It\u2019s not just about brain size; we also need to consider what other abilities our brains have and how these abilities developed over time. Unfortunately, there's not much physical evidence to help us; ancient tools don\u2019t tell us what kind of speech our ancestors could produce. However, we can see changes in the mouths, throats, and tongues of early humans. Around 100,000 years ago, humans started to be able to make more complicated sounds. Before that time, scientists can only make guesses about whether early humans communicated with simpler sounds."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "People, not nature, decide that girls should like art and languages, and boys should do maths and science. It\u2019s also difficult to find good examples of women working in science. In cartoons and stories, scientists and inventors are often men. Some people think scientists are strange, don\u2019t have good social skills, or work alone. These ideas are not always true, but they might make girls not want to be scientists. If girls saw more women in science, they might feel more confident and like they belong."}

Students write and make the newspaper themselves. A survey shows that students and teachers like the newspaper for fun, to learn about culture, and to get work experience. It costs a lot of money to print the newspapers. Also, some students find it difficult to get a copy because they have to go to the university in person. Finally, many copies are thrown away and become litter on campus."}

{"text_id": "119-b1", "simplified": "Much of what the speaker said seemed correct. I think there\u2019s a risk that the more we connect online, the more lonely we feel. I don\u2019t think this is a big problem for my generation, because we grew up without technology. We know how to be alone and we know it\u2019s okay. But young people, who are under 20, are different. They are always communicating online, so they don\u2019t feel quiet time. They might not learn to enjoy being by themselves. Also, they learn to talk by sending messages that can be changed. This means they don\u2019t learn how to have real conversations with people face to face."}
