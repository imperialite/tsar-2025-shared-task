Some dogs were born wild, and some were pets that people left. Some dogs live alone, and some live in groups. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs. They found that the dogs are good at living in the city. They learned that crossing the street with people is safer. Some dogs even seem to know about traffic lights."}

They made art to make people think about war. And they made art about people not being treated fairly. Other street artists just wanted to make pretty art. In South America, many street artists went to work in poor places. They added color, life, and beauty to grey city walls."}

But it might be difficult because warm winters mean there are more pigs now."}

These young people were put in a maze where a monster called the Minotaur ate them. But a young man named Theseus fought and killed the Minotaur. Suzanne thinks Katniss Everdeen is like a Theseus from the future."}

So, by the time they are 80, a person might have dreamed 140,000 times. We forget almost all our dreams, but we still remember a few thousand over our lives. It is easy to think that sometimes a dream can be like something that happens in real life by chance, especially if it is about something common."}

Our brain sorts memories from the day. When we wake up, we try to understand these random pictures and feelings, and we make a story."}

Also, many clothes that shops cannot sell go to other countries. This makes more problems for money and the world."}

It is much more likely to die from a violent crime than from a fight between groups. But the number of murders in the world slowly went down. It was 8 for every 100,000 people in 2000, and about 5.3 in 2015."}

Wasfia wanted Bangladesh to be strong. So she used her love for climbing mountains and helping people. She wanted to change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing when she worked in Tibet and Nepal. Most people in Bangladesh have never seen a mountain because it is a flat country near the sea. Her work is helping. People in her country and around the world are noticing."}
{"text_id": "102-a2", "simplified": "Most people think poor countries are in a bad way. They believe these countries have great poverty, bad leaders, and little hope for change. But this is not true. Things are getting much better. In the last 20 years, over 700 million people earned more money and are not poor anymore. Also, 6 million fewer children die from sickness each year. Many more girls go to school, and many people can get clean water."}

Think about what is happening now: army machines like drones and robot guns kill people with little human help. Soon, robots may kill by themselves. They will follow orders, but finally, they will decide who to kill. I think this is very bad and unsafe for people. We need to be very careful with what we let machines do."}

Many songs are about normal people who work hard. They feel sad and angry because they don't get rich or famous. For example, \"Glory Days\" is about people in a small town remembering when they were young and everything was good. \"Downbound Train\" is about a young man whose life is bad after he loses his job. You can imagine the singer is writing about real people he knew. This album shows the singer is very talented."}

So, what can we do to keep it scary? No phone signal! If you are the hero in a scary movie, it is very likely that you will have no phone signal when you need to call for help. Or your phone battery will die when you are talking. Maybe both will happen."}

Now, the same thing is happening again to the Cavendish banana, which took Big Mike's place. The Gros Michel banana was easy to move, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet. It was grown a lot on farms in Central America. United Fruit was a big company that grew and sold bananas in South America. They grew many bananas very well. They made new plants from parts of old plants, not from seeds. They grew many plants close together in fields."}

Spider bites can hurt, but they rarely kill. For example, the Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia has not killed anyone since 1981, when medicine was made for its bite. But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. When they are scared, they shoot out tiny hairs. These hairs can get stuck in your skin or eyes and make you itch."}

It is important what our brains can do. It is also important when and why they changed. We do not have many clues about this. Things from our old family do not tell us what they said. But we can see how the mouth, throat, and tongue of early people grew. About 100,000 years ago, people could make hard sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early people used simple sounds to talk."}
{"text_id": "116-a2", "simplified": "Society, not nature, tells girls to like arts and humanities, and boys to like math and physics. Also, young girls don't see many women doing science jobs. Cartoons often show men as smart scientists or astronauts. Some people think scientists are strange, don't talk much, or work alone. This is wrong, but it might make girls not want to be scientists. If girls saw more good examples of women in science, they would feel better and want to join these subjects."}

Printing the newspapers costs a lot of money. Also, some students cannot easily get the paper. They have to go to the university to get a copy. Another problem is that many copies become trash on campus."}

{"text_id": "119-a2", "simplified": "Many things the speaker said were true. I think that if we are connected too much, we may feel alone. This is not a big problem for older people like me. We lived a long time without much technology. We know how to be alone, and that is okay. But for young people, it is different. They text a lot and are never really alone. They might not learn to enjoy their own time. Also, they learn to talk by writing messages they can change. So, they do not learn to talk face-to-face right away with someone."}

{"text_id": "22-b1", "simplified": "One of the most interesting examples of wild animals living in a city are the wild dogs in Moscow. About 35,000 wild dogs live on the streets of Moscow. Some of these dogs were born wild, while others were pets that their owners left. Some dogs live by themselves, and others live in groups. In 2010, scientists studied the dogs and found that they have learned to live very well in the city. They have learned that it is safer to cross the street with people, and some dogs seem to understand traffic lights."}

Baboons are special animals, and there are not many left. To help baboons and keep them safe from people, the city has workers called Baboon Monitors. These workers scare baboons away from the city or catch them and let them go in the countryside. This plan has worked a little, but it is hard to stop baboons from coming back to the city because they find food easily there."}

This means I don't spend time traveling to work or talking much with co-workers.

The problem is that I work late into the evening, sometimes missing dinner, because I don't have set office hours."}

They did not care that their owner, Mr. Carter, was visiting for the first time in ten months. Sam waited. Mr. Carter did not like to come to this place, and Sam was happy about that. Sam knew that if he stayed away from his boss, he would keep his job longer. Mr. Carter wiped sweat from his neck. His shirt was wet. His skin was already red from the sun in June. He looked like a man who worked inside while others worked outside."}

Because of these protests, the city council decided to try something else against the pigs that was more peaceful. They stopped shooting them. Now, they have put up fences and made a rule that people cannot feed the pigs. We will see if this plan works. However, it might be hard because warmer winters mean there are more pigs than before."}
{"text_id": "31-b1", "simplified": "The Hunger Games books were inspired by Suzanne Collins' love for old Greek stories. When she was a child, she really liked the story of Theseus and the Minotaur. In this story, Athens was controlled by Crete, but the people of Athens fought back. As a punishment, King Minos of Crete made Athens send seven boys and seven girls to Crete every year. These young people were put into a maze and eaten by a monster called the Minotaur. But a young man named Theseus fought and killed the Minotaur. Suzanne Collins thinks Katniss Everdeen is like a modern Theseus."}

There, it was a way to say no to spending and buying too much on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which are big shopping days after Thanksgiving. On Buy Nothing Day, people protest in different ways and cut up their credit cards. All year, 'Buy Nothing' groups help people exchange and fix things they already have."}
{"text_id": "34-b1", "simplified": "Is graffiti art or a crime? It depends on what you think, but in many places, writing on public or private buildings is seen as a crime.

{"text_id": "35-b1", "simplified": "What does the art world think about graffiti and street art? More and more, people see it as real art. Big shows of street art have happened in galleries in Paris, London, and Los Angeles. In 2008, American artist Elura Emerald had a street art show in a New York gallery. She said street artists are just showing their feelings and not hurting anyone. She thought they should be liked and praised."}

So, by the time they reach 80 years old, the average person could have had 140,000 dreams. Even if we forget most of our dreams (95\u201399%), we still might remember a few thousand over our lifetime. It is not too hard to believe that, by chance, something from a dream might happen in real life that is similar to it, especially if the dream is about something common in everyday life."}

Baboons can be aggressive and have attacked many pets, so many city residents are not happy about them."}

Usually, the hero lives a normal life at the start. Then, something happens that makes them go on an adventure that changes everything. In Star Wars, Luke lives a normal life with his aunt and uncle, fixing robots. He finds a message from Princess Leia to Obi-Wan Kenobi inside a robot called R2D2. This message is like \"the call to adventure\" that starts him on his journey."}

{"text_id": "44-b1", "simplified": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, two main ideas about dreams became popular. One idea was that dreams show us things our conscious mind hides. Freud thought that if we understand dreams, we can understand our hidden feelings and problems. The other idea was different. It said that dreams are just random brain activity when the brain organizes memories and events from the day. When we wake up, we try to understand these random images and feelings and make them into a story."}

There were many things to distract me: house chores, more tea, and my family asking for my attention. So I went to a coffee shop to work, but the internet was not good, and I drank too much coffee. Finally, I decided to rent a desk in an office with five other freelancers. I liked getting ready for work in the morning and being able to concentrate in an office."}

He says, \"I just want to love God.\" After that, his family and teachers let him make his own decisions about religion."}

So, you can change a bad dream into a good one, or you can guide your dream like a movie director. Instead of just finding out what your dreams mean, you will be making them. But you might still want to have some dreams where your subconscious mind tells you what it is thinking."}

But charity shops cannot sell all these clothes. 'Fast fashion' quickly becomes old-fashioned. It is often too low in quality to recycle. People do not want to buy it used. A lot of clothes are thrown away. Many clothes that charities cannot sell are sent to other countries. This causes more money and environmental problems."}

In that kind of place, bosses made all the big choices, and no one usually questioned them. But her team in Sweden was used to a different way of working. There, people who worked for bosses often worked with them to find answers and make choices. In Sweden, bosses act more like helpers who want people to think for themselves and to ask questions."}

When Gabriela gave them exact instructions, they felt she did not trust them to do their job well. They also realized that Gabriela took it personally when they challenged her decisions or suggested changes. They explained that this was just how they always worked."}

But because of his appearance, it is a very painful experience. No one wants to sit next to him, and he notices other children staring at him or talking about him quietly. Fortunately, he becomes friends with Jack, a boy in his class, and Summer, a girl he talks to at lunch. But it is not just the first day that is hard. Auggie soon learns that his classmates do not want to touch him because they are afraid of catching 'the plague'. As the school year progresses, Auggie experiences many intense ups and downs until an unexpected and sad event at a school camp completely changes things."}
{"text_id": "73-b1", "simplified": "The two men looked at the north part of the land. It was very large, and they could not see the end of it. The fences were hard to see from where they stood. Even a bored and rebellious teenage boy could not walk away and escape. Sam looked at the largest horse, which was hitting the ground with its hooves. He wondered if the boy could ride a horse. A good rider could find a lot of trouble far away from anyone else. But maybe someone who knew nothing about horses and wanted to get away from his father would find even more trouble."}

While climbing high mountains in icy conditions and severe storms remains highly perilous, the world's most accomplished climbers are now seeking new challenges. Gerlinde Kaltenbrunner from Austria developed a passion for mountain climbing as a teenager. After she completed her schooling, she worked as a nurse, but she continued to climb in her leisure time."}
{"text_id": "75-b1", "simplified": "Gerlinde climbed Mount Everest. After that, she decided to climb all fourteen of the world's mountains that are 8,000 meters high. To make it more challenging, Gerlinde climbs without using oxygen tanks. This is risky because not enough oxygen at the top of high mountains can affect how her brain and body work. Gerlinde uses her fame as a climber to support a charity that helps poor children and orphans in Nepal."}

Bridges are important links that carry cars, trucks and trains over water, mountains or other roads. So, they are a very important part of civil engineering. People check them very carefully, especially if they fall down."}

{"text_id": "80-b1", "simplified": "Dogs that live in groups have learned that people are more likely to give food to smaller, cuter dogs. So, these dogs go to ask for food for the whole group. Some dogs have even learned to use the city's subway system to travel from one part of their area to another! Scientists don't know how these dogs know when to get off the train. One idea is that they use their great sense of smell and have learned to know the smells of their favorite places. Another idea is that they have learned to know the names of stations they hear in announcements. People who ride the subway are now used to seeing dogs on the trains, so the dogs travel without many people noticing them."}
{"text_id": "81-b1", "simplified": "Ed Stafford from the UK was the first person to walk the entire Amazon River. He began in the Andes mountains in Peru and finished at the river's end in Brazil. This journey took him two years and four months, covering 6,000 kilometers. The Amazon rainforest is full of dangerous animals like poisonous snakes, crocodiles, and jaguars, so Ed was always in danger. Fortunately, he survived with only many mosquito and ant bites."}
{"text_id": "82-b1", "simplified": "In Britain, the average person spends over \u00a31,000 on new clothes each year. This is about four percent of their money. This might not seem like a lot. But, this number hides two bigger problems for society and the environment. First, many people buy clothes with credit cards. British people currently owe about \u00a3670 per adult to credit card companies. This is 66 percent of what they spend on clothes. Also, people are spending money they don't have. They are buying things they don't need. Britain throws away 300,000 tons of clothes every year. Most of these clothes go into rubbish dumps."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified": "Ed's walk would have been impossible without technology. He used a radio to ask the people of the rainforest for food and permission to cross their land. Many of them came to meet him and helped guide him through the most difficult terrain. As he walked, Ed wrote a blog, recording his day-to-day experiences. He used the media interest in his trip to protest about the destruction of the rainforest and raise money for environmental and children's charities in Brazil and Peru."}
{"text_id": "84-b1", "simplified": "Businesses like how much money they can make from the sharing economy. They want to use things that are not used enough. A popular business model is when companies make a website or app. This lets customers find people who can give them a product or service. For example, Airbnb helps people rent out their extra rooms and houses for money. Another example is Uber. It lets people use their own cars as taxis to earn more money when they have free time."}
{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "Zoos are very important today because they help animals have babies, especially those that are in danger. In nature, some very rare animals have problems finding partners and having babies. Also, people who hunt illegally, losing their homes, and other animals can be a danger to them. A good zoo helps these animals live and have babies in a safe place. When there are fewer wild animals, there is a bigger risk that animals in a group will be too much alike. Having more babies in zoos helps with this. Animals born in zoos can go back into the wild to make the groups of animals more different."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified": "Both types of accidents are rare. Ships and trains can make a bridge fall down for different reasons. Trains can hit a bridge hard and make it fall. Boats are very big and heavy. Even if they move slowly, they can make a bridge fall. To stop bridges from falling, we need to plan for it. New technology can find weak spots in bridges. Safer workplaces and better designs can help stop these bad accidents."}

Then he remembers there are hungry sharks in the water, and he realizes he must climb back into the lifeboat. One by one, the animals in the lifeboat kill and eat each other until only Pi and the tiger are left. Luckily for Pi, the tiger, whom he names Richard Parker, is seasick and has no immediate interest in eating him."}

Because they are worried about what might happen, Pi's parents decide to shut down their zoo and move to Canada. They sell some of the animals to other zoos in North America, and the family travels by ship to Canada, bringing the rest of the animals with them. During the trip, a terrible storm hits, and the ship sinks. Sadly, Pi's family and the sailors on the ship all drown. However, Pi ends up in a lifeboat with a hyena, a zebra, an orangutan, and a huge tiger."}

It made 152.5 million dollars in its first weekend in North America."}
{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified": "Dreams might be our brain sorting our thoughts from the day. These thoughts appear as symbols in our dreams. When we are awake, we mostly think with words, like we are talking to ourselves. But when we are sleeping, the part of our brain that uses language becomes less active, and the part that controls feelings becomes more active."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "Good relationships make you happy. A study found that most happy people have strong connections with friends and family, and they spend time together often. You also need to share your personal feelings with at least one person; this is called 'self-disclosure'. Just one person for a deep conversation is enough, in addition to other friends. It's not enough to only have many friends for activities or talking about light topics like music or sports. That deeper connection is very important. Some people need to learn how to listen well to others to build stronger relationships."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Carol Dweck, a psychologist, said that our brains can change. We can learn new skills and talents, even if we are not good at them at first. Many times, we tell people they are good at something because of their natural talent, like saying 'You are good at finding small things' or 'You are good at planning parties.' But studies show that if we praise the way people do things, like how much they try, how they try new things, and how they solve problems, we can help them learn new skills and get better at what they do."}
{"text_id": "93-b1", "simplified": "The rover regularly checks the air. In 2014, it found methane in the air. Methane is a basic organic molecule and a part of natural gas. Methane only lasts for a few hundred years, which means something on Mars is making more of it. NASA says Mars releases thousands of tons of methane. The amount of methane changes with the seasons, almost as if the planet is breathing it."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified": "When Carol Dweck, a smart person, worked with ten-year-old kids, she gave them hard puzzles. Some kids liked the puzzles and knew they could learn. She said they had a 'growth mindset.' These kids thought about what they could do later. But other kids felt bad because they thought the puzzles showed they were not good enough. They had a 'fixed mindset' and could not think about getting better. Some of these kids even said they might cheat next time. Others looked for kids who did worse to feel better about themselves."}
{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified": "Horror films often use empty places. These might be old hospitals, empty houses, or towns where no one lives. There's something interesting about lonely, empty places. What was it like when people lived there? Why did they go away? Perhaps it's also very quiet, which can be frightening. Also, these empty places are good for horror films because it's easier to believe you won't have phone service there."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified": "Basements are scary places in horror movies. Something is usually hiding there, or a bad person has hidden their tools there. Basements are always dark and often wet. You can only get to them by a small staircase. And basements are always strange, even when nothing is there."}
{"text_id": "97-b1", "simplified": "Gary Collins, a policeman not working at the time, was watching the London riots on TV. He knew some people right away and stopped his vacation early to help find out who they were. He spent six months looking at security camera videos and was able to identify 190 people, many just by their eyes. His help was very important for the investigation. Even with a lot of video (200,000 hours), computer programs that recognize faces only found one person."}
{"text_id": "98-b1", "simplified": "I believe it's interesting to think about making our bodies better to help us evolve faster. Imagine putting a computer in your brain! Soon, we can do this. We will improve our math skills, how we see and hear, and our memory. This idea will become more common."}
{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "The talk was very good. The speaker said some very true things. For example, about parents. How can we expect teenagers not to text while doing their homework? Their parents text while cooking dinner or waiting at a red light. She also said it\u2019s true that people want to be in many places at once. So they switch between talking in real life and talking online. I see this often with my teenage daughter and her friends. They meet, but then they sit together quietly while each one talks to different people online."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "Even though news makes us feel the world is becoming more dangerous, there's also good news. From the end of World War II to 1990, 30 wars happened, and over 100,000 people died in each. Now, we still have civil wars, but most countries are getting along better than before. But, terrorism has increased a lot recently. Since World War II, more regular people have died in wars than soldiers. Still, for regular people, the numbers aren't all bad. Even though you are nine times more likely to die from violent crime than from war, the number of murders around the world went down a little. It went from 8 out of every 100,000 people in 2000 to about 5.3 in 2015."}

She has seen many international projects in her home country that teach and train women and girls. But often, when these projects end, the women and girls are left with nothing. Wasfia realized that Bangladesh needed to help itself. So, she combined two things she loved: climbing mountains and human rights. She wanted to change how people think about women in her country. She started climbing when she worked on projects in Tibet and Nepal. Most people in Bangladesh, which is a flat country near the sea, have never seen a mountain. Her plan seems to be working. People in her country and around the world are paying attention."}
{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "Many people think that developing countries are in a bad situation, suffering from extreme poverty and bad governments, with little chance of improvement. However, this idea is quite wrong. In reality, a significant change is happening. Over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have improved their financial situation and are no longer poor. In addition, 6 million fewer children die each year from diseases, more girls are attending school, and many more people have access to clean water."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "Managers sometimes give good comments before and after bad comments to make feedback seem more positive. But if this happens too often, employees might think the good comments are just to hide the bad ones, which makes the good comments less helpful. Instead, good comments should not just be used to make bad comments feel softer. They should be given to show what employees are doing well and to help them keep doing a good job."}
{"text_id": "104-b1", "simplified": "I am part of a group called the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. We are not talking about movie robots that look scary. We are talking about machines like drones and robots that are used in wars now. These machines can kill people with very little human control. Soon, there might be robots that can decide on their own who to kill. I think this is wrong and dangerous for people. We need to be careful about what we let machines do."}

{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "Born in the USA is a rock album with fast music. But its songs also have strong feelings. The happy rock music hides sad stories about the American dream. Many songs are about normal people who work hard. They are angry and sad because they don't get rich or famous. For example, \"Glory Days\" is about small-town people remembering their youth when they felt powerful. \"Downbound Train\" tells about a young man whose life is ruined after losing his job. It seems like the singer is writing about real people he knew. He might be thinking about the life he would have had if he wasn't a star. This album shows that the Boss is a very special and talented artist."}

This is to help fix problems caused by people, like catching too many fish, making the water dirty, and throwing trash. Lewis has seen these problems himself. He has swum over coral reefs that are now white because the water is too warm. He has also seen places in the Red Sea where there is no life, only plastic. Lewis thinks nature can get better if we give it a chance. But we need to hurry. If we don't start taking care of our oceans, we might have a problem we can't fix."}

We live for more years, are healthier, have more freedom, and are happier. Pinker says the real problem is that people are not using good ideas like thinking with logic and using science. When people listen to others who make them feel like they only care about their own group, or feel like there is no hope, or do not trust others, we can damage important things like democracy and countries working together."}
{"text_id": "111-b1", "simplified": "In old scary movies, people needing help couldn't easily call for help or the police. Mobile phones make that less believable now. So, to keep movies exciting, there's no phone signal! If you're a hero in a scary movie, when you really need to call for help, you probably won't have any signal. Or your phone battery will die just when you're calling. Or both."}

Now, the same thing is happening to the Cavendish banana, which took its place. The Gros Michel banana was easy to move, had a thick skin, and tasted sweet. It was grown a lot in Central America. United Fruit, a big banana company then, grew many bananas. They copied plants from stems instead of using seeds. They grew many plants together in fields."}

If a spider bites you, it might hurt, but it almost never kills you. The Sydney funnel-web spider in Australia hasn't killed anyone since 1981, because doctors made a special medicine for its venom. But be careful with hairy spiders like tarantulas. If they are scared, they can shoot out many small, itchy hairs. These hairs can get stuck in your skin or in your eyes."}
{"text_id": "114-b1", "simplified": "This scary movie theme was very popular in horror films of the late 20th century. It starts with teenagers enjoying themselves. Then, everyone dies except one girl. At the beginning, the girl is usually innocent, shy, and not very strong. By the end, she has become the toughest and most resourceful person. The last girl almost always wins in the end."}
{"text_id": "115-b1", "simplified": "If we want to understand how we got our ability to use complex language, we need to study how our brains are different from animal brains. It is not just about brain size. It is important to know what else our brains can do and when and why they changed this way. We don't have many physical clues for this. Things left by our ancestors don't tell us what kind of speech they could make. But we can see something in the remains of early humans: how their mouth, throat, and tongue developed. About 100,000 years ago, humans learned to make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess if early humans used simpler sounds to communicate."}
{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "Society, not nature, tells us that girls should prefer arts and humanities, and boys should prefer math and physics. Also, young people do not see many good female role models in science jobs. Cartoons and stories often show male scientists, inventors, or astronauts. There is also a sad idea that scientists are odd, not good at talking to people, or that their work is lonely and not part of the rest of the world. These are wrong ideas from the media. They might make girls not feel like scientists, and think science is not a good career. If girls saw more good female role models in science, they would feel more confident and more like they belong in those subjects."}

A survey shows that students and staff at the university really value the newspaper for entertainment, cultural learning, and work experience. Printing the newspaper is expensive. Also, some students find it hard to get a copy because they have to go to the university to pick it up. Another environmental problem is that many copies end up as trash on campus."}

My generation, who lived without technology for a long time, doesn't have this problem as much. We know how to be alone, and that it's okay. But for people under 20, it's different. They are so busy talking that they don't experience being alone, and they might not learn to like their own company. Also, they learn to talk through messages that can be edited, instead of learning how to have real conversations with people in person."}
