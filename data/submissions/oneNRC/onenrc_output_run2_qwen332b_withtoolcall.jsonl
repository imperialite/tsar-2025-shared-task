It might sound like a movie idea, like the 1998 film 'Armageddon,' but the Hypervelocity Asteroid Mitigation Mission for Emergency Response (HAMMER) is a real NASA plan. Large rockets weighing eight tons would be launched at an approaching asteroid to change its path. If the asteroid is too close for this to work, the rockets could carry nuclear bombs to break it apart instead."}

Sending zoo-bred animals back to the wild can make their genes more different."}
{"text_id": "83-b1", "simplified": "These accidents are very rare. Boats and trains can cause bridge collapses for different reasons. Trains hit bridges with high speed, while boats use their heavy weight, even when moving slowly. To prevent this, plan ahead. Use technology to find weak parts in bridges, make work areas safer, and design better bridges. This can reduce these bad accidents."}
{"text_id": "84-b1", "simplified": "At first, Pi is very scared of the animals and jumps into the sea. Then he remembers there are hungry sharks nearby and knows he must climb back onto the lifeboat. The animals on the lifeboat fight and eat each other. Soon, only Pi and the tiger remain. The tiger, named Richard Parker, feels sick on the sea and does not want to eat Pi right now."}
{"text_id": "85-b1", "simplified": "When Pi is 16, a new government comes to power. His parents disagree with it, so they close the zoo and decide to emigrate to Canada. Some animals are sold to North American zoos, and the family travels by ship with them. A heavy storm hits during the journey, causing the ship to sink. Unfortunately, Pi's family and the sailors drown, but he survives in a lifeboat with a hyena, zebra, orang-utan, and large tiger."}
{"text_id": "86-b1", "simplified": "The Hunger Games had a lot of success since 2008 when Suzanne Collins wrote it. The book is available in 26 languages and sold millions of copies around the world. Collins was the first author for young readers to sell over one million e-books. It is now a popular Hollywood movie and made $152.5 million in its first weekend in North America alone."}
{"text_id": "87-b1", "simplified": "Dreams might be a way our mind puts together the ideas from the day, but they show up in dreams with hidden meaning. When we are awake, we mostly think in words, like having talks with ourselves. When we sleep, the part of the brain for language is less active and the part for feelings is more active."}
{"text_id": "88-b1", "simplified": "Good relationships are important for happiness. A study showed that most happy people have close friends and family and spend time with them often. It is helpful to talk about personal feelings with at least one person. Friends to play or chat with are not enough. Talking deeply is more important. Listening well can help build stronger connections."}
{"text_id": "89-b1", "simplified": "Carol Dweck, a psychologist who encourages growth mindset, said the brain can change. People can learn skills and get better at them, even if they are difficult when you start. Many people praise the result or natural talents, for example: 'You see details well' or 'You organize events well.' But research shows that praising effort, trying new ways, and solving problems helps people learn and improve."}
{"text_id": "90-b1", "simplified": "The rover checks the air often. In 2014, it found methane. Methane is a simple compound in natural gas. It does not stay in the air for very long. So, something on Mars is making new methane. NASA says Mars releases a lot each time. Methane levels go up and down with the seasons, as if the planet is breathing it in and out."}
{"text_id": "91-b1", "simplified": "At the start of her career, Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck gave ten-year-olds problems a little too hard. One group reacted positively, saying they loved challenges and knew they could improve. She called this a 'growth mindset' focused on future goals. Another group felt their intelligence was judged and they had failed. These children had a 'fixed mindset' and couldn't imagine getting better. Some might cheat later, others looked for kids who did worse to feel better about themselves."}
{"text_id": "92-b1", "simplified": "Horror movies use places that are empty or abandoned, like old hospitals, lonely houses, or ghost towns. These places feel scary because they are quiet. People wonder why they were left empty and what happened there. Directors choose them because the phone signals are weak, so nobody can call for help."}
{"text_id": "93-b1", "simplified": "In horror films, basements are often scary. They are dark and sometimes damp. A narrow staircase leads to them. Usually, there is something or a bad person hiding there. Basements feel creepy even when empty."}
{"text_id": "94-b1", "simplified": "Gary Collins was not on duty when he saw the London riots on TV. He saw people he recognized and stopped his holiday to help identify them. For six months, he watched CCTV videos and found 190 people, many by looking at their eyes. His work helped the investigation a lot. Even with 200,000 hours of footage, facial recognition software found only one person."}
{"text_id": "95-b1", "simplified": "I find it interesting to think about how we can make human evolution go faster by improving our bodies. Imagine putting a computer in your brain! Soon this will be possible and we can improve math skills, seeing and hearing better, and our memory. This idea will become more common in the future."}
{"text_id": "96-b1", "simplified": "It was an interesting talk. The speaker made good points. For parental influence, how can we expect teenagers not to text while working on homework if they see their parents using social media when cooking dinner or waiting at a red light? She talked about how people want to be in two or more places at once. They go back and forth between real-life chats and online messages. I often see this with my teenage daughter and her friends. They plan to meet but just sit in silence as they each talk online."}
{"text_id": "97-b1", "simplified": "News stories about violence in the world can give us some hope. After World War II and before 1990, 30 wars caused over 100,000 deaths each. Now, while civil wars still exist, countries generally live in peace more than before. Terrorism has increased recently. Since World War II, wars have killed more civilians than soldiers. However, the situation for civilians isn't completely negative. While violent crimes cause more deaths than political conflicts, the global murder rate dropped from 8 per 100,000 in 2000 to 5.3 in 2015."}
{"text_id": "98-b1", "simplified": "Wasfia has spent her life supporting human rights. In Bangladesh, she has seen many projects try to help women and girls learn and grow, but many times these projects end and they have nothing. Wasfia realized Bangladesh needed to show strength, so she combined her love for climbing mountains with human rights work. She began climbing in Tibet and Nepal, where mountains are common, because in Bangladesh most people have never seen one. People in her country and around the world are now noticing her efforts."}
{"text_id": "99-b1", "simplified": "Many people believe that developing countries face serious problems such as extreme poverty, strict leaders, and lack of hope for change. However, this is not accurate. A great transformation is taking place. In the last 20 years, more than 700 million people have improved their incomes and left poverty. Additionally, six million fewer children die each year from diseases, and millions more girls are attending school. Clean water is now available to many more people."}
{"text_id": "100-b1", "simplified": "Many managers try to add positive comments before and after negative feedback to make it better. But if this becomes a common habit, employees might start thinking that the positive parts are just a way to make the bad messages easier to hear, which makes the good comments less meaningful. Instead, managers should give positive feedback to really support and encourage good work. This is more helpful than just using it to hide the negatives."}
{"text_id": "101-b1", "simplified": "I support the campaign against killer robots. Scary robot movies show them as mean, but right now, military machines like drones and robot weapons are killing people with little help from humans. The next step might be machines that can decide who to hurt. This sounds very dangerous and not right. We must be careful about the tasks we give to machines."}
{"text_id": "102-b1", "simplified": "More people learn English compared to all other languages together. English is spoken in the most countries in the world. Chinese has the largest number of native speakers by far. There seems to be a limited relationship between native speaker count and learner numbers. However, learner numbers are more closely connected to the number of countries where the language is spoken."}
{"text_id": "103-b1", "simplified": "Your manager calls you into her office and wants to talk about your work on the last project. You are worried all weekend and think about what mistakes you might have made. On Monday morning, when you go into her office, she starts by saying you did well. You wonder if this is part of the usual feedback method called the 'feedback sandwich'. This method means: start with good news, mention any problems, end with good news again."}
{"text_id": "104-b1", "simplified": "Born in the USA is an upbeat rock album. The lyrics have strong emotions. The catchy rock songs talk about the darker parts of the American dream. They focus on ordinary people who work hard but feel life gives them no success or recognition. For example, 'Glory Days' is about people in a small town remembering when they were young and full of hope. 'Downbound Train' tells about a young man who loses his job and faces big problems. The artist clearly writes about real people he knew and his own life if he hadn\u2019t become famous. This album shows Bruce Springsteen\u2019s unique and special talent."}
{"text_id": "105-b1", "simplified": "Lewis wants more protected ocean areas\u201410% instead of 3%\u2014to fix the harm from human actions like fishing too much, pollution, and trash. During his trips to the sea, Lewis has seen this damage directly. He has seen coral reefs turning white because of warmer water temperatures and lifeless areas near the Red Sea filled with plastic. Pugh thinks nature can heal if we let it, but time is running out. If we don't take care of our oceans soon, we might face a problem that's too hard to fix."}
{"text_id": "106-b1", "simplified": "Terrie Sharp is a best-selling author. She has won the Olive Crime Writer Award two times. She was born in Glasgow in a place with a lot of crime. She learned to stay quiet, avoid trouble, and open car doors with a knife. She only uses this knowledge to write her books. Now she talks on shows like Police Today and goes to writing conferences across the UK."}
{"text_id": "107-b1", "simplified": "Is life getting worse each day? Can we make progress? In his book Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker shows that life is getting better. People live longer, healthier, freer and happier today. Pinker says the big problem is that some people are trying to hurt reason and science. When leaders use group loyalty, belief that nothing can change, and distrust, they can cause big damage to democracy and global help between countries."}
{"text_id": "108-b1", "simplified": "In old horror movies, the main characters could not or found it very hard to call for help or the police when they were in trouble. Today, mobile phones make this harder to believe. How do filmmakers keep the tension? No phone signal! If you are the hero in a horror film, it\u2019s almost always true that when you need to call for help, there\u2019s no signal. Sometimes the phone runs out of power during the call, or there's no signal."}
{"text_id": "109-b1", "simplified": "In the 1950s, banana farmers in Central America were losing their main banana, the Gros Michel. Now, the same problem is happening with the new banana, the Cavendish. Gros Michel bananas have thick peels and a sweet flavor. This made them easy to transport. The main company, United Fruit, grew their bananas quickly by taking cuttings from plants. They planted the crops in crowded fields."}
{"text_id": "110-b1", "simplified": "Spiders have poison to catch their food. This poison does not hurt people. There are 40,000 kinds of spiders, but only 25 are dangerous to humans. A spider bite can cause pain, but it is not deadly. In Australia, the Sydney funnel-web spider is dangerous. However, antivenom has made it safe since 1981. Be careful with tarantulas. When they feel threatened, they throw small hairs. These hairs can cause itching or pain in the skin or eyes."}
{"text_id": "111-b1", "simplified": "This horror film typical thing was very common in horror films from the 1900s to 1999. A group of teenagers have fun at the start, and by the end, all are dead except one girl. At the beginning, the girl is usually kind, shy, and not very strong. By the end, she becomes the strongest and most clever person. The girl almost always wins at the end."}
{"text_id": "112-b1", "simplified": "To understand where our complex language came from, we need to compare human brains with those of other animals. It\u2019s not just about brain size. Human brains developed new abilities over time. Objects from early humans don\u2019t show the sounds they could make. Around 100,000 years ago, humans had a mouth, throat, and tongue that could make complex sounds. Before that, scientists can only guess how they communicated."}
{"text_id": "113-b1", "simplified": "Society, not nature, decides that girls should prefer arts and humanities. Boys are expected to do math and physics. Young people rarely see women doing science jobs in TV or books. Many stories show scientists, inventors, or astronauts as men. Some girls think science workers are boring, lonely, and not good with people. This is not true, but it can make girls feel science is not for them. Seeing more women in science roles could help girls feel more confident and welcome in these subjects."}
{"text_id": "114-b1", "simplified": "The Scallion is printed weekly and distributed for free in university buildings, with approximately 10,000 student readers. It is written and produced completely by students. A survey shows university students and staff value it greatly for fun, culture, and gaining work experience. Printing the newspapers costs a lot of money. Also, some students find it hard to get the paper because they need to visit the university in person. Another environmental problem is that many copies become litter on campus."}

{"text_id": "116-b1", "simplified": "The speaker's words made sense to me. I think getting more connected can make people feel more alone. This isn't a big problem for my generation because we lived without tech before. We know how to be alone and understand it's OK. Young people under 20 are different. They talk a lot through messages and never feel alone. They might miss learning to enjoy being alone. They learn to chat using messages they can edit, but forget real talks that happen face-to-face."}
{"text_id": "117-b1", "simplified": "Don't always give negative feedback after positive. If you always mix positive and negative, the good parts may be ignored. Sometimes, just give positive feedback because it's good. Avoid adding criticism unless needed."}
